But turning back I cry to you: Merciful and compassionate Father, I have sinned; receive me in repentance, O God, and have mercy on me!"

I am starved of good deeds and clothed in the shame of my transgression, for I have been stripped bare of divine grace. I cry out to you: I have sinned! Yet I know your loving kindness; accept me as one of your hired servants, merciful Christ, at the prayers of the Apostles who loved you."

You are adorned with the stars of your miracles and wonders of healing! Intercede fervently before the Lord for us that our prayers may be accepted as pure and sweet-smelling incense; that we may all be accounted worthy to venerate the life-giving Cross and to behold it with fear. Send down on us, then, your mercy, O Savior, as the lover of mankind."
