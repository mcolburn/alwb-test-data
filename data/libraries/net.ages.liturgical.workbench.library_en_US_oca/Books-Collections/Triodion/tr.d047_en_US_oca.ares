Therefore let us cry to Christ, the giver of all blessings: You fasted and endured the Cross for our sake: enable us to partake uncondemned of your divine Pascha, to lead our lives in peace, worthily glorifying you with the Father and the Spirit."

For he who sees all that is done in secret will reward us for our abstinence. Let us fulfill the fast without sad faces, but ceaselessly praying in the depths of our hearts: Our Father, in heaven, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil!"

The light of the blind is spat upon by sinful men, and gives his back to scourgings for the sake of the captives. When the pure virgin Mother beheld him on the Cross, she cried out in pain: Woe to me! What is this you have done, my child! Your beauty was fairer than that of any man, yet you appear lifeless, with no form or comeliness. Woe to me, my light. I cannot bear to look upon you sleeping. My being is wounded, for a sword has pierced my heart! But I praise your Passion; I bow before your compassion! Long-suffering Lord, glory to you!"
