trVE.AposIdiomelon1.text = "I am rich in passions, and clothed in the deceitful robe of hypocrisy. I rejoice in the sins of self-indulgence. There is no limit to my lack of love. I neglect my spiritual understanding that lies at the gate of repentance. Make me, Lord, like Lazarus, poor in sin, that I may not be tormented in the unquenchable fire, praying in vain for a finger to be dipped in water to relieve my burning tongue. But make me dwell in the bosom of Abraham, as the lover of mankind."

And so for your sakes, I rejoice, my friends, for by this you shall learn that I know all things. For I am God, inseparable from the Father, though in my visible appearance I am man. Let us go, then, to bring him back to life, that death may feel the defeat and complete destruction I bring upon it, granting the world great mercy."

Let us cry: Merciful Lord, as once by your dread authority you raised up your friend Lazarus, so now give life to us all, and grant us your great mercy!"

His sisters lament bitterly, beholding his tomb. But Christ comes to bring his friend to life, that a single hymn of praise may be offered up by all with one accord: Savior, blessed are you! Have mercy on us!"
