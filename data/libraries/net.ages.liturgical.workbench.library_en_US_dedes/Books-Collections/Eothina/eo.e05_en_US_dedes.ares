How was it that to Peter You granted to understand Your resurrection by the grave clothes alone, whereas to Luke and Cleopas You spoke as You walked with them, and in speaking did not immediately reveal yourself? And for this reason You were upbraided as the only visitor to Jerusalem who was unaware of what had happened there in those days. Then You, who arrange everything for the benefit of Your creature, interpreted the prophecies concerning You, and when You blessed the bread they recognized You. Even before this, their hearts were burning in recognition of You. Then to the Disciples, who were gathered together, at once they clearly proclaimed Your resurrection; by which have mercy on us."
