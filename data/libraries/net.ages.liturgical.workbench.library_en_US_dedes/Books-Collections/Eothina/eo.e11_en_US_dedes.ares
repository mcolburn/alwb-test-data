eo.Doxasticon.text = "When You showed yourself to Your Disciples, O Savior, after the Resurrection, in return for his love, You gave Simon the feeding of the sheep and asked him to take care to tend them. That is why You said: \"If you love me, Peter, tend my lambs, tend my sheep.\" Then, he at once displayed his affection and inquired about the other Disciple. By their entreaties, O Christ, protect Your flock from wolves that would injure it."
