eo.Doxasticon.text = "It was early dawn, and the women came to Your tomb, O Christ. But Your body, which they longed for, was nowhere to be found. While they were perplexed about this, the men in dazzling apparel stood by and said to them, \"Why do you look among the dead for the One who is alive? He has risen, as He told you. Why do you not remember His words?\" And they believed them, and proclaimed what they had seen. But the good news seemed to the Disciples an idle tale; this is how slow they still were to understand. But Peter ran and saw, and going home he glorified Your wonders."
