But her thinking was still mundane, weak woman that she was. And that is why she was sent away and not allowed to touch You, O Christ. Nevertheless, she was sent as a herald to Your Disciples; and she spoke to them the good tidings, and announced that You were ascending to Your Father. Count us, with her, worthy of Your appearance, O Master and Lord."
