You heard the Father's voice from heaven bearing witness to His Sonship. And you saw the Spirit in the form of a dove showing that the voice was directed towards the One being baptized. And you, who are superior to all the Prophets, never cease interceding on our behalf, as we loyally observe your memorial."
