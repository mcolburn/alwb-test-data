Yes, O Lord, Who are easy to be entreated; You alone are merciful and You love mankind; You are sorrowful for our evil deeds; You know how the mind of man leans towards wickedness, even from his youth; You do not desire the death of a sinner, but rather that he should repent and live. For the salvation of sinners, though being God, You became a created being for the sake of Your creatures. You have said: \"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\" You sought the wandering sheep; You searched diligently for the lost coin, and having found it, You said: \"He that comes to me I will not cast out.\" You did not abhor the sinful woman who washed Your precious feet with her tears; You said: \"As often as you fall, get up, and you shall be saved.\" It is You, who said: \"There is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.\" O merciful Master, look down from on High, giving us, Your sinful and unworthy servants, shelter under the grace of the Holy Spirit in this hour; and take up Your abode in these Your servants, who acknowledge their iniquities and draw near to You in faith. Accept them because of Your love towards mankind, forgiving them whatever they have done amiss, whether by word, deed, or thought, and cleanse them from every sin; and abiding ever present with them, preserve them for the remaining years of their life, that, walking ever in Your statutes, they may in no way again become an object of joy to the devil; so that also in these, Your all-holy name may be glorified."

euUNC.Key0701.text = "O Lord our God, You chasten and again heal; You lift the indigent from the ground and dunghill; Father of orphans, and Haven of tempest-tossed; Physician of the ailing, Who without toil bears our weaknesses, and accepts our infirmities; it is You, Who cheerfully show mercy, and pass over our iniquities, taking away our unrighteousness; quick to help and slow to wrath; You breathed on Your Disciples, and said: \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven.\" It is You Who accept the repentance of sinners and have the power to pardon countless and grievous sins, bestowing healing upon all who continue in weakness and long-enduring illness. It is You, Lord, Who have also called me, Your humble, sinful and unworthy servant, caught up in many sins, and wallowing in the pleasures of life, to the holy and exceedingly lofty degree of the priesthood, and to enter within the innermost veil, into the holy of holies, where the holy Angels desire to penetrate and hear the voice of the Lord God announcing glad tidings, and to behold with their own eyes the presence of the sacred Oblation, and to enjoy the divine and sacred Liturgy. You, Lord, deemed me worthy to minister Your heavenly Mysteries, and offer You gifts and sacrifices for our sins, and the ignorances of people; and to mediate for Your reason-endowed sheep, so that, through Your great and ineffable love for mankind, You may blot out their transgressions. All-merciful King, hear the voice of my prayer at this hour and holy day, and at all times and places; and to these, Your servants, who are ailing in soul and body, grant Your healing, remitting their sins, and pardoning their transgressions both voluntary and involuntary, treating their incurable wounds, and every ailment and malady. Give health to their souls, You, Who touched Peter's mother-in-law, who, having been cured of her fever, arose and ministered to You. O Master, grant healing and deliverance from every devastating pain to these Your servants. Remember Your mercies and compassion; and that the mind of man inclines toward evil from his youth; that no one is without sin upon earth, for You alone are without sin. You came and saved the human race, and set us free from the bondage of the enemy. For if You enter into judgment with Your servants, none will be found clean from stain; but every mouth shall be sealed, not having any defense; for as discarded rags is all our righteousness before You. Therefore, O Lord, remember not the sins of our youth."
euUNC.Key0702.text = "For You are the hope of the hopeless, and the rest of those who labor and are heavy laden with iniquity; and to You we ascribe glory, together with Your Father, who is from everlasting, and Your all-holy and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages."

euUNC.Key0800.title = "6th Prayer"
euUNC.Key0801.text = "We thank You, Lord, our good and loving God, Physician of our souls and bodies, Who painlessly have borne our infirmities, and by Whose bruises we all have been healed. You are the Good Shepherd, Who came in search of the wandering sheep. You give consolation to the fainthearted, and life to the broken­hearted. You healed the hemorrhage of the woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, and freed the daughter of the Canaanite woman from the cruel demon. You remitted the debt of the two debtors and forgave the sinful woman. You healed the Paralytic and forgave his sins. You justified the Publican with Your word, and received the Robber at his last confession. You took upon Yourself the sins of the world, by being nailed to the Cross. We pray to You and entreat You, O God; in Your goodness, loose, remit, and forgive the sins and transgressions of Your servants, both voluntary and involuntary, in knowledge and in ignorance, trespass and disobedience, at night and during the day; whether they be under the curse of a priest or a parent; whether they feasted their eyes, indulged their sense of smell, touched and gratified themselves, or tasted fornication; or through whatever impulse of the flesh and of the spirit they have alienated themselves from Your will, and from Your holiness. Forgive whatever sins they or we have committed; for You are a good God, Who remembers not evil, and loves mankind, permitting us not to fall into the unclean life, neither to follow in wayward paths. Yes, Lord and Master, hear me, a sinner, in this hour, on behalf of these Your servants. Overlook all their trespasses, as a forgiving God. Deliver them from eternal punishment; fill their mouths with praise of You; open their lips that they may glorify Your holy name; stretch forth their hands to perform Your commandments. Direct their feet aright, in the way of Your Gospel, strengthening all their members and their thoughts by Your grace. For You are our God, Who through Your holy Apostles gave us a command­ment saying: \"Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in Heaven.\" And again: \"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\" And as You hearkened to Hezekiah in the sorrow of his soul, at the hour of his death, and did not overlook his prayer, in like manner hear me, Your humble, sinful and unworthy servant, praying to You at this hour. For You are the Lord, Jesus Christ, Who in Your mercy and love for mankind commanded us to forgive those who fall into sin, even seventy times seven; Who laments over our wickedness, and rejoices over the return of those who have strayed. For as is Your Majesty, so also is Your mercy, and to You we ascribe glory; together with Your Father Who is from everlasting, and Your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages."

euUNC.Key0900.title = "7th Prayer"
euUNC.Key0901.text = "O Master, Lord our God, Physician of souls and bodies, it is You Who soothe the chronic pains and heal every infirmity and malady of the people. You desire that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, and You will not the death of the sinner, but rather that he should repent and live. For You, O Lord, in the Old Testament, ordained repentance for sinners: for David and the Ninevites, and for those before and after them. But also in the new dispensation of Your coming in the flesh, You called not the righteous but the sinners to repentance; like the publican, the harlot, the robber, and the blasphemer and great persecutor Paul, receiving them all through repentance. Peter, Your great Apostle who denied You three times, You received in repentance, and promised him, saying: \"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give You the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.\" Therefore, O merciful and loving God, encouraged by Your faithful promise, we pray and entreat You at this hour. Hear our prayer and accept it as incense offered to You. Visit these Your servants, and if they have transgressed in either word or deed or thought, by night or by day, if they have come under the curse of a priest or their own anathema, or have sworn an oath, we pray to You; loose, pardon, and forgive them, O God, overlooking their transgressions and their sins, committed by them knowingly or in ignorance. And if they have trans­gressed Your commandments, or have erred, as bearing flesh and living in the world, or by the prompting of the devil, forgive them, as a merciful and loving God; for there is no man who lives and does not sin. Only You are sinless; Your righteousness is to all eternity, and Your word is truth. You did not create man for destruction, but for the keeping Your commandments, and to inherit life incorruptible. To You we ascribe glory, together with Your Father, Who is from everlasting, and Your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages."

euUNC.Key1006.text = "Holy King, compassionate and very merciful Lord Jesus Christ, Son and Logos of the living God, You wish not the death of the sinner, but that he should return and live. Therefore, not my sinful hand do I lay on the heads of these people who have come to You in sins and who seek the forgiveness of their sins from You; but rather You extend Your mighty and powerful hand that is in this holy Gospel Book, which my brother celebrants are holding over the heads of Your servants. Together we pray and entreat Your love for humanity, which is most sympathetic and not resentful. O God, our Savior, as through Your Prophet Nathan You granted David the forgiveness of his sins when he repented, and as You accepted the penitential prayer of Manasseh, so also in your customary love for humanity accept these Your servants who are repentant of their offences, and overlook all their transgressions. For You are our God, who commanded that those who fall into sins should be forgiven seventy times seven. Your mercy is as great as Your majesty. And all glory, honor and worship belong to You and Your unoriginate Father and Your all-holy Spirit, now and forever, and to the ages of ages."
