Judean generation, faithless and adulterous, come and behold Him, whom Isaiah saw, who for us is present in the flesh. See how He weds Himself to the New Zion as one chaste, and divorces Himself from the censured assembly. As to a wedding untainted and undefiled, do undefiled children, unclaimed by evil, rush, acclaiming. With them singing praises, let us cry out the angelic hymn, \"Hosanna in the highest to You, who possesses the great mercy.\""

As the Bestower of Light, O Savior, You gave sight to the blind. And with Your disciples, You entered the Holy City seated on a donkey's colt, as one mounted on the Cherubim, fulfilling proclamations that the Prophets made. And the children of the Hebrews went out to meet You with palm leaves and branches. We, therefore, likewise wave our olive branches and our palm leaves, and gratefully cry out to You, \"Hosanna in the highest! Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord!\""
