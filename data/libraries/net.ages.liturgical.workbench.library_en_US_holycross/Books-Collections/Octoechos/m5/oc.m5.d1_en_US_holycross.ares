ocVE.Stichera6.text = "The guards were thus instructed by the evildoers: keep hidden the resurrection of Christ; take the pieces of silver and say that, as we were sleeping, the body was stolen from the tomb. But who has ever seen or heard that a body, especially a body anointed and naked, was stolen from a tomb and the grave clothes left lying there?
