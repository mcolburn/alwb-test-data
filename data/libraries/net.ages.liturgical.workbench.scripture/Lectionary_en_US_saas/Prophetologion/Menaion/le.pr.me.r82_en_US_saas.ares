leprVE.reading.text = "Thus says the Lord: ‘I remember your compassion and youth and your love and maturity, so as to follow the Holy One of Israel,’ says the Lord. ‘Israel, the beginning of His harvest, was holy to the Lord. All who devour him shall transgress, and evils will come upon them,’ ” says the Lord. Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all families of the house of Israel. Thus says the Lord: “What transgression have your fathers found in Me, so as to go far from Me, to follow after vain and worthless things? They did not say, ‘Where is the Lord, who led us out of the land of Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in an unknown and untrodden land, a land that was waterless and barren, in which no one traversed and where no son of man dwelt?’ I brought you into Carmel to eat its fruit and its good things, but you entered and defiled My land, and made My heritage an abomination. The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’ But those who handle the law did not trust Me, and the shepherds acted profanely toward Me. The prophets prophesied by Baal and walked after unprofitable things. “Therefore I will yet bring charges against you,” says the Lord, “and I will bring charges against the sons of your sons. For pass by the islands of Chettim and see. Send to Kedar and consider diligently. See if such things happened, whether nations will change their gods; though they are not gods. But My people changed their glory to a glory from which they will not profit. Heaven was amazed at this and was exceedingly horror-struck,” says the Lord."
