leprVE.reading.text = "On that very same day, that the Lord brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their army, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, the first -begotten, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel. Then Moses said to the people: Remember this day, in which you went out from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place. You shall therefore keep this law. Then it shall be, when the Lord your God brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to your fathers, and gives it to you, that you shall set apart to the Lord all that open the womb, that is, every male. So it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you shall say to him, ‘With a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thus it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that the Lord killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of cattle. Therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all males that open the womb, but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ It shall be as a sign on your hand and immoveable before your eyes, because thus says the Lord the Almighty: The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me. If a woman conceived and bore a male child, then on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. For thirty-three days she is not to come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification are fulfilled. When the days of her purification are fulfilled, she is to bring to the priest a lamb of the first year as a whole burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering, to the door of the tabernacle of testimony. But if she is unable to afford a lamb, she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons. So the priest shall make atonement for her. For they are Mine as a restitution offering from among the children of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of the firstborn from all the children of Israel, from man to cattle; on the day I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to Myself."
