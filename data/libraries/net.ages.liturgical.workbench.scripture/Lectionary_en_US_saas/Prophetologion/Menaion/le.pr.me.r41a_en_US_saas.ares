leprVE.reading.text = "Now Moses came to Horeb, the mountain of God. Then the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he saw the bush burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed. So Moses said, \"I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed.\" When therefore the Lord saw him turn aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, \"Moses! Moses!\" Then he said, \"Here I am.\" So He said, \"Do not come any closer. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.\" Moreover He said, \"I am the God of your father -- the God of Abraham, the God Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" Moses then hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God. Then the Lord said, \"Indeed, I have seen the affliction of My people in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrow. So I came down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey.\""
