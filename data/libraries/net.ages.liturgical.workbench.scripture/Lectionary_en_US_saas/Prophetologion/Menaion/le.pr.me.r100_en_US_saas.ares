leprVE.reading.text = "Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, \"On the first day of the first month, the new moon, you shall set up the tabernacle of testimony. You shall put in it the ark of the testimony and cover the ark with the veil. You shall bring in the table and lay out its offering, and bring in the lampstand and install its lamps. You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark, and put up the veil for the door of the tabernacle of testimony. You shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; and you shall consecrate it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy. You shall anoint the altar of burnt offerings and all its utensils and consecrate the altar. The altar shall be most holy.\" Thus Moses did; according to all the Lord commanded him, so he did. Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the tabernacle was filled with the Lord's glory. But Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of testimony because the cloud overshadowed it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
