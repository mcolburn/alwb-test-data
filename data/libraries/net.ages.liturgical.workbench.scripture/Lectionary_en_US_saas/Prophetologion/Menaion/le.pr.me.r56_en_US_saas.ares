leprVE.reading.text = "Now there was a certain man from Zorah, from the tribe of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and could not give birth. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, “Indeed now, you are barren and have not given birth, but you shall conceive a son. Now therefore, be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean. For behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb.” So the woman went in and told her husband, saying, “A Man of God came to me , and His appearance was like the appearance of an Angel of God, very frightening. And He said to me, ‘Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. Now drink no wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the child shall be holy to God from the womb to the day of his death.’ ” Then Manoah prayed to the Lord and said, “Lord Adonai, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born.” So the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, “The woman will guard herself from everything I have told her. She may not eat anything that comes from the vine of wine, and let her not drink wine or similar strong drink, nor eat anything unclean.” Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, “What is Your name, so when Your words come to pass we may honor You?” And the Angel of the Lord said to him, “Why do you ask My name, is it extraordinary?” When the Angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, Manoah knew this to be the Angel of the Lord."
