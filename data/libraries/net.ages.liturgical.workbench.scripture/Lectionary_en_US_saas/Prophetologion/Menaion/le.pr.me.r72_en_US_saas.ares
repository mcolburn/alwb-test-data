leprVE.reading.text = "“If you walk in My ordinances and keep My commandments, and do them, then I will give you rain in its season, the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage, and the vintage shall last till the time of sowing; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. War shall not pass through your land, and I will give peace in the land; and you shall lie down, and none will make you afraid; and I will utterly destroy the bad wild animals from the land. You will chase your enemies, and they shall fall by slaughter before you. Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you. For I will look upon you and make you fruitful, and multiply and establish My covenant with you. You shall eat the old harvest of the past two years, and clear out the old because of the new. I will establish My covenant among you, and My soul shall not abhor you. I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people. Now if you do not obey Me, neither do all these ordinances, but your soul disobeys them and despises My judgments, so as not to do all My commandments but to shatter My covenant, I also will do thus to you: I will bring difficulty upon you, both the itch, the jaundice, the gangrenous eyes, and the withering away of your life. You shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. I will set My face against you, and you shall fall before your enemies. Those who hate you shall pursue you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you. I will crush your excessive arrogance; I will make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze. Your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its produce, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit. I will also send among you the wild animals of the land; and they will eat you, and utterly destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your highways shall be desolate. I will scatter you among the Gentiles, and the sword shall suddenly destroy you. Then your land shall be a desert and your cities deserts. That they transgressed and disregarded Me and walked contrary to Me, and that I also have walked in hostility to them and destroyed them in the land of their enemies,” says the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel."
