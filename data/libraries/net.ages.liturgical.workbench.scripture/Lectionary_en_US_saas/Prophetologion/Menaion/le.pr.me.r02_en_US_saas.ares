leprVE.reading.text = "The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways for His works; He established me in the beginning before time. Before He made the earth, and before He made the abysses, before the going forth of the fountains of waters, before the mountains were created; and He begot me before all hills. The Lord made the fields and the uninhabited places and the inhabited heights under heaven. When He prepared heaven, I was present with Him, and when He set apart His throne upon the winds. When He made strong the things above the clouds, and made sure the fountains under heaven, and made strong the foundations of the earth, I was working beside Him; I was He in whom He rejoiced; daily and continually I was gladdened by His face."
