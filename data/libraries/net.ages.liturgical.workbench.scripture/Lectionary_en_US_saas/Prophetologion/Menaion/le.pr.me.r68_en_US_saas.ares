leprVE.reading.text = "Thus the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then he would return to the camp, but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle. Then Moses said to the Lord, \"Behold, You say to me, 'Bring up this people.' But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, 'I know you above all, and you have also found grace in My sight.' Now therefore, I pray, if I have found grace in Your sight, reveal Yourself to me, that I may see You clearly and find grace in Your sight, and know this great nation is Your people.\" So He said, \"I Myself will go before you and give you rest.\" Then he said to Him, \"If You Yourself do not go up with us, do not bring us up from here. For how then will it be known that Your people and I found grace in Your sight, except You go with us? So both I and Your people shall be glorified beyond all the nations on the earth.\" The Lord then said to Moses, \"I will also do this thing you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you above all.\" Moses replied, \"Reveal Yourself to me.\" Then God said, \"I will pass before you in My glory, and I will proclaim My name, the Lord, before you. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\" But He said, \"You cannot see My face; for no man can see My face and live.\" Moreover, the Lord said, \"Here is a place by Me: you shall stand on the rock. So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by. Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.\" Then Moses rose early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai as the Lord commanded him. Now the Lord descended in the cloud; and He stood with him there, and he called upon the name of the Lord. Then the Lord passed before his face and proclaimed, \"The Lord God, compassionate, merciful, longsuffering, abounding in mercy and true.\" So Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the ground and worshiped."
