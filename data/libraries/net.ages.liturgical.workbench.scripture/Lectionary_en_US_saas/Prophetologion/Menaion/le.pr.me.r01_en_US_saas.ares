leprVE.reading.text = "The Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am your God; be pleasing before Me and blameless. I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly; and you shall be a father of many nations. No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be your God and the God of your seed after you.” Then Abram fell on his face [and worshiped the Lord]. Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. This is the covenant you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations: Every male child among you shall be circumcised; and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It shall be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. A child of eight days old shall be circumcised by you—every male child throughout your genealogy. And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall be cut off from his people; for he has broken My covenant.”"
