leprVE.reading.text = "Return from heaven, and look from Your holy and glorious dwelling-place. Where are Your zeal and Your strength; where is the multitude of Your mercy and Your compassion, so as to be patient with us? You are our Father, although Abraham did not know us, and Israel did not acknowledge us; but You, O Lord, are our Father. You delivered us, and from the beginning Your name was upon us. Why have you led us astray, O Lord, from Your path, and hardened our hearts so as not to fear You? Return for the sake of Your servants, for the sake of the tribes of Your inheritance, that we may inherit a small portion of Your holy mountain. For our adversaries trampled down Your sanctuary, and we have become as we were from the beginning, when You did not rule us, neither did we call upon Your name. If You open heaven, trembling shall take hold of the mountains before You, and they shall melt as wax melts before the fire. The fire shall burn up the adversaries, and the Lordâ€™s name shall be manifest among the adversaries; and the nations shall be troubled by Your presence. When You do glorious things, trembling shall take hold of the mountains because of You. From of old we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen any God but You, and Your works which You shall do for those who wait for Your mercy. For mercy shall meet with those who do righteousness, and they shall remember Your ways. And now, O Lord, You are our Father, and all we are clay, the work of Your hands. Do not be exceedingly angry with us, and do not remember our sins in an opportune time. And now look upon us, for we are all Your people."
