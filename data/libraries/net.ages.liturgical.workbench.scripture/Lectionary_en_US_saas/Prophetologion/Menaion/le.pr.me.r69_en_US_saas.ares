leprVE.reading.text = "In those days, Elijah came to Beersheba of Judah, where he left his servant. But Elijah himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat under a juniper tree. Then he lay down and slept under a tree. Unexpectedly, someone touched him and said to him, Arise and eat. Then Elijah looked, and there by his head was a cake made of wheat and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. Again the angel of the Lord came back a second time, touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is a great many days for you. So he arose, ate and drank; and he went with the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, as far as Mount Horeb. There he went into a cave and rested. Behold, the word of the Lord came to him and said to him, Go out tomorrow and stand on the mountain before the Lord; and behold, the Lord will pass by, and before the Lord, a great and powerful wind will be rending the mountains and shattering the rocks; but the Lord will not be in the wind. After the wind, an earthquake, but the Lord will not be in the earthquake. After the earthquake, there will be a fire, but the Lord will not be in the fire. After the fire, there will be a sound of a gentle breeze, and the Lord will be there. So when Elijah heard this, he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. Then the Lord said to him, Go and return on your way to the desert of Damascus. And you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah as prophet in your place.\""
