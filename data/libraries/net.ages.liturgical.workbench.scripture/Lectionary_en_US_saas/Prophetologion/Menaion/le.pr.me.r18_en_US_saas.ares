leprVE.reading.text = "So Jacob went on his way, and saw the hosts of God encamped. When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s encampment”; and he called the name of that place Encampments. Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. And he commanded them, saying, “Speak thus to my lord Esau, ‘Thus your servant Jacob says, “I sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now. I have oxen, donkeys, sheep, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.” ’” Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him.” So Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people with him and the oxen and sheep into two companies. Thus Jacob said, “If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the other company will escape.” Again Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord who said to me, ‘Return to the land of your nativity, and I will deal well with you,’ let me be satisfied with all the righteousness and all the truth You have shown Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff.”"
