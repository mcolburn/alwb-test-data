leprVE.reading.text = "Then Elijah said to the people, “Come near me.” So all the people came near to him. Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, for the Lord said, “ Israel shall be your name.” Then he built an altar with the stones in the name of the Lord, and he repaired the altar of sacrifice that was scattered about, and around the altar he made a furrow holding two measures of seed. He piled the firewood on the altar he had made, divided the whole burnt offering, laid it on the firewood, and laid it in order on the altar. Then he said, “Bring me four pots of water, and pour it on the whole burnt offering and pour it on the unlit firewood.” They did so. Again Elijah said, “Do it a second time.” So they did it again. Again he said, “Do it a third time.” So they did it a third time. And the water ran all about the altar, and even the furrow became filled with water. After this, Elijah cried out to heaven and said, “O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, answer me , O Lord, answer me this day with fire, and let this people know You are the God of Israel, and I am Your servant; and for Your sake I do all these works. Hear me, O Lord, hear me with fire, and let these people know You are the Lord God, so as turn the heart of this people back.” Then fire fell from the Lord out of the heaven and consumed the whole burnt offering, the firewood, and the water in the furrow. The fire also licked up the stones and the soil. So all the people fell on their faces, and they said, “Truly, the Lord is God; He is God.”"
