leprVE.reading.text = "Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, as my lord can see, this city is a pleasant place to live, but the water is bad, and the ground is barren.” So Elisha said, “Bring me a new water pitcher and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him. Then he went out to the spring of the waters and cast salt into it, and said, “Thus says the Lord: ‘I have healed these waters; from them there shall no longer be death or barrenness.’ ” So the water was healed by the word Elisha spoke, and so it remains today."
