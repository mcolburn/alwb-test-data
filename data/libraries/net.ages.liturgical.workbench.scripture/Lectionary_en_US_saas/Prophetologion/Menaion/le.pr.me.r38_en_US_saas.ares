Who will declare these things or tell us things from the beginning? Let them bring forth their witnesses, and be proven right; and let them speak the truth. \"You are My witnesses, and I am a witness,\" says the Lord God, \"and My Servant whom I chose, that you may know and believe, and understand that I am He. Before Me there was no other God, nor shall there be after Me. I am God, and besides Me there is no one who saves. I proclaimed, and I saved. I denounced foreign gods so there were none among you. You are My witnesses, and I am a witness,\" says the Lord God. \"Even from the beginning, there is no one who can deliver out of My hands; I will work, and who will reverse it?\" Thus says the Lord God who redeems you, the Holy One of Israel."
