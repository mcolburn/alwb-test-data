leprVE.reading.text = "Wisdom has built her house, she has set up her seven pillars. She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine, she has also set her table. She has sent out her servants to call from the highest places in the town, \"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!\" To him who is without sense she says, \"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. Leave simpleness, that you may reign forever; seek wisdom, and live; and improve understanding by knowledge. He who corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the counsel of saints is understanding. For to know the law is the character of a sound mind. For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.\""
