leprVE.reading.text = "When the righteous are praised, the people shall rejoice, for immortality is in its memory because it is known both by God and by man. For his soul was pleasing to the Lord. Therefore long for my words; yearn for them, and you will be instructed. Now this love is the keeping of her laws. Honor wisdom, that you may reign forever, and I will hide no mysteries from you; for He is also the guide of wisdom and the corrector of the wise. For both we and our words are in His hand. For wisdom, the artisan of all things, taught me. So in herself, wisdom is a spirit that is rational, holy, for she is the radiance of eternal light, a spotless mirror of the operative power of God and the image of His goodness, and makes holy souls friends of God and prophets. For wisdom is more beautiful than the sun and more than every constellation of stars. Compared with light she is found to be superior. Wisdom rescued from troubles those who served her. She guided a righteous man on straight paths and gave him knowledge of holy things. She protected him from his enemies, kept him safe from those who plotted against him, and arbitrated a strong contest for him, so he might know that godliness is more powerful than anything, but evil cannot overcome wisdom. Nor will justice, when it cross-examines, pass him by. For they said among themselves, as they reasoned incorrectly: Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare a widow, nor respect the aged gray hair of an old man. Let our might be our law of righteousness. Let us lie in ambush for the righteous man, because he is useless to us and opposes our deeds and accuses us of sins against our upbringing. He claims to have knowledge of God, and he calls himself a child of the Lord. He has become for us as a refutation of our purposes; even seeing him is a burden to us, because his life is unlike that of others; for his paths go in a different direction. We are considered by him as a hybrid, and he avoids our ways as something immoral. He considers the last things of the righteous as blessed. Let us see if his words are true, and let us put these last things to the test at the end of his life. Let us test him with insult and torture that we may know his gentleness and test his patient endurance. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for there shall be a visitation because of his words. So they reasoned these things and were led astray, for their malice blinded them. But they did not know the mysteries of God, who has authority over life and death, who forgives sins and saves in time of affliction, the One who saves from every evil, because the Lord is compassionate and merciful. The Lord opposes the arrogant, but He gives grace to the humble."
