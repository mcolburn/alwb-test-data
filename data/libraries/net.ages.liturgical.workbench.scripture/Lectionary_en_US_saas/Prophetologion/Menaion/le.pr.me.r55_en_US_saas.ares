leprVE.reading.text = "Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; and I will bless him, and he shall become nations; and kings of peoples shall be from him.” Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his mind, “Shall a child be born to a man who is one hundred years old, and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?” Then God said, “No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, “I have not yet had a child until now, and my lord is old also?” Then the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh within herself, saying, ‘Shall I surely bear a child, since I am old?’ Is anything impossible with God?” Now the Lord visited Sarah as He said, and the Lord did for Sarah as He had spoken. For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in old age, at the set time, of which God had spoken to him. She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne a child in my old age.” So the child grew and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the same day Isaac was weaned."
