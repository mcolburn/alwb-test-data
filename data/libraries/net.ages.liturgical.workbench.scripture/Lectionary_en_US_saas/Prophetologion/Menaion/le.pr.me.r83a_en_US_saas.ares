leprVE.reading.text = "Then it came to pass, when Joshua was at Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing before him with a sword drawn in his hand. So Joshua came near and said to him, “Are you for us or on the side of our adversaries?” He said to him, “I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord.” Then Joshua fell on his face upon the earth and said to him, “O Master, what do you command your servant?” The chief captain of the Lord said to Joshua, “Loose the shoe from your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy.”"
