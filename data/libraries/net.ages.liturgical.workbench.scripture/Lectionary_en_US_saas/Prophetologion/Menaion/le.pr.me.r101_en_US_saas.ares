leprVE.reading.text = "When Solomon finished building the house of the Lord..., [he] assembled all the elders of Israel in Zion, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion... The priests took up the ark and the tabernacle of testimony and all the holy furnishings in the tabernacle of meeting. King Solomon and all Israel were before the ark... Then the priests brought in the ark to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, to the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubim. For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and the holy things...  Nothing was in the ark except the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant... When the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud filled the house, so the priests could not stand there ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord filled the house."
