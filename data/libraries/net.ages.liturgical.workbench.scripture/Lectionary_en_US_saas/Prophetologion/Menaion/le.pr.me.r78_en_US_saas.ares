leprVE.reading.text = "Then it came to pass in the first month of the second year after their departure from Egypt, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up. So Moses set up the tabernacle, placed the capitals, inserted the bars, and set up the posts. He spread out the curtains over the tabernacle and put the veil of the tabernacle on it above, as the Lord commanded Moses. Then he took the testimonies, put them into the ark, and inserted the poles under the ark. He then brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung up the veil of the covering, and partitioned off the ark of the testimony, as the Lord commanded Moses. Then he put the lampstand in the tabernacle of testimony, on the south side of the tabernacle; and he placed its lamps before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses. He also put the gold altar in the tabernacle of testimony in front of the veil; and he burned the incense compound on it, as the Lord commanded Moses. Then he put the altar of burnt offering before the doors of the tabernacle. He also set up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar. So Moses finished all the work. Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the tabernacle was filled with the Lordâ€™s glory. But Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of testimony because the cloud overshadowed it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Whenever the cloud ascended from the tabernacle, the children of Israel prepared to depart with their belongings. But if the cloud did not ascend, they did not prepare to depart until the cloud ascended. For before all Israel, throughout all their journeys, the cloud was above the tabernacle by day, and fire was over it by night."
