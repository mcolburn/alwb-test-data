lemcVE.reading1.text = "Now the Lord said to Abram, “Get out of your country, from your kindred and from your father’s house, to a land I will show you. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you; and in you all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.” Then Abram departed as the Lord said to him, and Lot went with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. So Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son and all their possessions and every soul they acquired in Haran, and they departed for the land of Canaan. Thus they came to the land of Canaan. Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, as far as the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land. Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your seed I will give this land.” And there Abram built an altar to the Lord, who appeared to him."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "(14:15-27)"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "A simple man believes in every word, But an astute man comes to repentance. A wise man fears and turns away from evil, But a man without discernment persuades himself to mingle with a lawless man. A quick-tempered man acts with recklessness, But a man with discernment bears many things. Men without discernment will share in evil, But the astute will take hold of perception. Evil men will slip and fall in the presence of good men, And the ungodly shall serve at the gate of the righteous. Friends will hate poor friends, But the friends of the rich are many. He who dishonors the poor sins, But he who has mercy on the poor is very blessed. Deceivers devise evil things, But good men devise mercy and truth. Devisers of evil things do not understand mercy and faithfulness, But mercies and faithfulness are with devisers of good things. To everyone who is careful there is an abundance, But he who is pleasure-taking and slothful shall be in want. The crown of the wise is astuteness, But the pastime of the undiscerning is evil. A faithful witness will rescue a soul from evil men, But a deceitful man kindles lies. In the fear of the Lord there is hope of strength, And to His children there remains support."
