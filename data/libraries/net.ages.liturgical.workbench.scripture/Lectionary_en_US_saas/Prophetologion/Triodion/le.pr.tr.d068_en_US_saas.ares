lemcVE.reading1.text = "Thus it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and saw their burdens. He also saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren of the sons of Israel. So he looked this way and that, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. When he went out the second day, he saw two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, \"Why are you hitting your neighbor?\" He replied, \"Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\" So Moses was alarmed and said, \"Surely this thing is known.\" Thus when Pharaoh heard this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, who fed the sheep of their father Jethro; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. Then the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. When they came to Reuel their father, he said to them, \"How is it you came so soon today?\" They replied, \"An Egyptian delivered us from the shepherds; and he also drew enough water for us and watered our sheep.\" So he said to his daughters, \"And where is he? Why have you left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.\" Then Moses dwelt with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses. So the woman conceived and bore Moses a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, \"I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.\" She again conceived and bore a second son, and he called his name Eliezer (for he said, \"The God of my father is my help, and He rescued me from the hand of Pharaoh\")."

lemcVE.reading2.text = "Then again as it so happened another day, the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the devil also came among them to present himself before the Lord. The Lord said to the devil, \"Where did you come from?\" Then the devil said before the Lord, \"I came here from walking around under heaven and going about all the earth.\" Then the Lord said to the devil, \"Have you considered my servant Job, since there is none like him on the earth: an innocent, true, blameless, and God-fearing man, and one who abstains from every evil thing? Moreover he still holds fast to his integrity, though you told me to destroy his possessions without cause.\" Then the devil answered the Lord and said, \"Skin for skin. Whatever a man has he will pay in full for his life. Yet truly, stretch out Your hand and touch his bones and his flesh, and see if he will bless You to Your face.\" So the Lord said to the devil, \"Behold, I give him over to you; only spare his life.\" Thus the devil went out from the Lord and struck Job with malignant sores from head to foot. So he took a potsherd to scrape away the discharge and sat on a dunghill outside the city. When a period of time passed, his wife said to him, \"How long will you hold out, saying, ‘Behold, I will wait a little longer, looking for the hope of my salvation’? Listen, your memory is wiped out from the earth: your sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb, which I suffered in vain and with hardships. You yourself are sitting down, spending the nights in the open air among the rottenness of worms; and I go about as a wanderer and a handmaid from place to place and from house to house, waiting for the setting of the sun, so as to rest from my labors and pains that now beset me. But say a word against the Lord and die!\" Then Job looked at her and said, \"You have spoken as one of the foolish women speaks. If we accepted good things from the Lord's hand, shall we not endure evil things?\" In all these things that happened to him, Job did not sin with his lips against God."

lemcTE.reading1.text = "O Lord, teach me and I will know. Then I saw their purpose. For I did not know I was like an innocent lamb led to be sacrificed. They plotted an evil device against me, saying, \"Come, let us put wood in his bread, and destroy him root and branch from the land of the living, so his name might not be remembered any longer.\" But, O Lord, You who judge righteously, who tests minds and hearts, let me see Your vengeance on them, for I have revealed my righteous plea to You. Therefore thus says the Lord against the men of Anathoth, against those who seek my life, and who say, \"Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord, lest you die by our hands.\" - \"Behold, I will visit them. The young men shall die by the sword, and their sons and daughters shall die by famine. There shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring calamities on the inhabitants of Anathoth in the year of their visitation.\" O Lord, You are righteous, that I may plead my case with You, to speak to You concerning judgments. Why does the way of the ungodly prosper, and all who deal treacherously flourish? You planted them, and they took root. They bear children and are fruitful. You are near in their mouth, but far from their mind. But You, O Lord, know me. You have proven my heart before You. Set them apart for the day of slaughter. How long will the land mourn and the grass of the field wither, because of the vices of those who dwell in it? The cattle and the birds are destroyed, because they said, \"God will not see our ways.\" \"Your feet run and grow weary... Gather together all the wild beasts of the field and let them come to devour her. Many shepherds destroyed My vineyard and defiled My portion. They turned My pleasant portion into an impassable desert. It was made a complete ruin.\" For thus says the Lord: \"Concerning all the evil neighbors who touch My inheritance, which I divided to My people Israel—behold, I shall draw them away from their land and will cast out Judah from their midst. Then it shall come to pass, after I cast them out, that I will return them and have mercy on them. I will settle them each in his inheritance and each in his land.\""
