When my enemy turns backward, they shall be feeble and perish before Your face. For You maintain my judgment and my right; You sit upon the throne, judging in righteousness. You rebuke the nations, and the ungodly man destroys himself; You blotted out their name, in their lifetime and unto ages of ages; the swords of the enemy are completely forsaken, and You pulled down their cities; their memory was destroyed with a noise, but the Lord abides forever; He prepared His throne in judgment, and He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall judge the peoples in uprightness. The Lord is also a refuge for the poor man, a helper in seasons of affliction; and let those who know Your name put their hope in You; for You, O Lord, do not forsake those who seek You. Sing to the Lord who dwells in Zion. Proclaim His dealings among the nations, for He who avenges blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the poor. Have mercy on me, O Lord, and see how my enemies have humbled me, You who raise me up from the gates of death, that I may proclaim all Your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will rejoice in Your salvation. The nations are trapped in the destruction they caused; their foot is caught in the trap they hid. The Lord is known in the judgments He makes; the sinner is caught in the works of his hands. Let sinners be turned back into Hades, and all the nations who forget God. For the poor man shall not be forgotten in the end; the patience of the poor shall not perish forever. Arise, O Lord, and do not let man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence. Set a lawgiver over them, O Lord, and let the nations know that they are men.  Why do You stand afar off, O Lord? Why do You disregard me in times of affliction? when the ungodly man behaves arrogantly, the poor are set afire; let him be caught in the counsels he ponders. for the sinner praises himself in the desires of his soul, and the unjust man blesses himself. The sinner provokes the Lord; He will not seek Him out because of the fullness of His wrath; God is not before him. His ways are defiled in every season; Your judgments are removed from his face; He shall rule over all his enemies, for he said in his heart, \"I will not be shaken; from generation to generation I will be without trouble.\" His mouth is full of cursing, bitterness and deceit; Suffering and pain are under his tongue. He lies in ambush with the wealthy; He kills the innocent in hidden places; His eyes look intently at the poor; He lies in ambush in a hiding place, like a lion in his den; He lies in wait to seize the poor man, to seize the poor man to drag him away; He will humble him in his snare; but he will bend down and fall when he rules over the poor. For he said in his heart, \"God forgets; He turned His face so as never to see it.\" Arise, O Lord God, let Your hand be lifted high, and do not forget Your poor. Why has the ungodly man provoked God? For he said in his heart, \"You will never call me to account for this.\" but You do see, You do perceive the suffering and pain, that You might deliver them into Your hands; therefore, the poor man will be left to You; You give help to the orphan. Break the arm of the sinner and the evil man; His sin shall be sought, and because of it he will not be found; the Lord will reign, but you, O nations, you will perish from His earth. The Lord hears the desire of the poor; Your ear heeds the readiness of their heart, to judge the orphan and the humble, that man may no longer increase his great boasting upon the earth."

I will call upon the Lord and praise Him, and I shall be saved from my enemies. The anguish of death surrounded me; the floods of the lawless troubled me greatly; the anguish of Hades encircled me; the snares of death ran me down.

Smoke ascended in His wrath, and burst into flame from His face; coals were kindled by Him. He bowed heaven and descended, and darkness was under His feet. And He rode upon the cherubim, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness His hiding place; His tabernacle was around Him, dark water in the clouds of the sky. Because of the brightness before Him, the clouds, the hail and the fiery coals passed through. The Lord thundered from heaven, the Most High gave forth His voice; and He sent forth His arrows, and scattered them; and He multiplied lightning, and threw them into utter confusion.

They overran me in the day of my misfortune, but the Lord became my support, and He led me into a wide place; He will deliver me, because He willed it for me. He will deliver me from my strong enemies and from those who hate me. The Lord will reward me according to my righteousness; and according to the purity of my hands He will recompense me, because I kept the ways of the Lord and did not act impiously against my God; for all His judgments are before me, and I did not remove His ordinances from me. I will also be blameless before Him, and I will keep myself from my lawlessness. The Lord will reward me according to my righteousness, according to the purity of my hands before His eyes. With the holy You will be holy; and with the innocent man You will be innocent; and with the elect You will be elect; and with the crooked You will be crooked. For You will save a humble people, and You will humble the eyes of the arrogant. for You will light my lamp, O Lord; O my God, You will enlighten my darkness. For in You I shall be delivered from ordeals, and in my God I shall leap over a wall. My God, His way is blameless; the teachings of the Lord are tried by fire; He is the shield of all who set their hope on Him. For who is God besides the Lord? And who is God besides our God? It is God who girds me with power, and He made my way blameless; who makes my feet like a deer and sets me on high places; who teaches my hands to make war; and You make my arms a bronze bow; and You gave me the shield of Your salvation; and Your right hand supported me; and Your instruction restored me to the end; and Your instruction will teach me. You widened my steps under me, and my footsteps were not feeble. I shall pursue my enemies and overtake them; and I shall not turn back until they faint; I shall wound them until they cannot stand; they shall fall under my feet. For You armed me with strength for war; You entangled under my feet all who rose up against me, and You gave me the back of my enemies; and You destroyed all who hate me. They cried out, but there was none to save them; even to the Lord, but He did not answer them. I will grind them fine, like the dust that blows in the wind; I will smooth them out, like mud in the streets. Deliver me from the contradictions of the people; You will establish me as the head of the Gentiles; a people I never knew served me; the moment they heard, they obeyed me; sons who are strangers lied to me; sons who are strangers became old, and they became lame because of their beaten path. The Lord lives, and blessed is my God. Let the salvation of my God be exalted, the God who vindicates me, and who subdued the peoples under me, my deliverer from the rage of my enemies; because of those who rise up against me, You will exalt me; You will deliver me from the unrighteous man. Therefore I will give thanks to You among the Gentiles, O Lord, and sing to Your name, He who magnifies the salvation of His king and shows mercy to His anointed, to David and his seed forever."

O my God, I will cry out by day, but You will not hear me; and by night, but not for a lack of understanding in me. But You dwell among the saints, O praise of Israel. Our fathers hoped in You; they hoped in You, and You delivered them. They cried out to You and were saved; they hoped in You and were not ashamed. But I am a worm, and not a man; a reproach of man and despised by the people. All who see me mock me; they speak with their lips and shake their head, saying, \"He hoped in the Lord, let Him rescue him; let Him save him since He delights in him.\" For You are He who drew me from the womb, my hope from my mother's breasts; I was cast upon You from the womb, from my mother's womb You are my God. Do not stand off from me, for affliction is near; there is no one to help. Many young bulls surrounded me; fat bulls encircled me. They opened their mouths against me Like a raging and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are shattered; my heart is like wax, melting into my stomach. My strength is dried up like an earthen vessel; my tongue cleaves to my throat; and You led me into the dust of death. For many dogs surrounded me; an assembly of evildoers enclosed me; they pierced my hands and my feet. I numbered all my bones, and they look and stare at me. They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots. But You, O Lord, do not remove Your help from me; attend to my aid. Deliver my soul from the sword and my only-begotten from the hand of the dog; Save me from the lion's mouth, my humiliation from the horns of the unicorns. I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the church I will sing to You. You who fear the Lord, praise Him. All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him; fear Him, all you seed of Israel. For He has not despised nor scorned the beggar's supplication, nor has He turned away His face from me; and when I cried out to Him, He heard me. My praise is from You in the great church; I will pay my vows before those who fear Him. The poor shall eat and be well-filled, and those who seek Him will praise the Lord; their hearts will live unto ages of ages. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the Lord; and all families of the Gentiles shall worship before You, for the kingdom is the Lord's; and He is the Master of the Gentiles. All the prosperous of the earth ate and worshiped; all going down into the earth shall bow down before Him, and my soul lives with Him. And my seed shall serve Him; the coming generation shall be told of the Lord, and they will declare His righteousness to a people who will be born, because the Lord made them."

Let deceitful lips become speechless when they speak lawlessness against the righteous with arrogance and contempt. How great, O Lord, is the abundance of Your goodness You hide for those who fear You, which You will work for those who hope in You In the sight of the sons of men. You shall hide them in the secret of Your presence from the disturbance of men; You will shelter them in Your tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. Blessed is the Lord, for He magnified His mercy in a fortified city. But I said in my ecstasy, \"Indeed, I am cast away from the countenance of Your eyes.\" Therefore You heard the voice of my supplication when I cried to You.

Take hold of weapon and shield, and rise up to my help. bring forth the sword, and confine those in opposition who pursue me; say to my soul, \"I am your salvation.\" Let those who seek my soul be dishonored and shamed; let those who plot evils against me be turned backward and disappointed. Let them be like dust in the wind's face, and let the Angel of the Lord afflict them. Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of the Lord pursue them. For without cause they hid the destruction of their trap for me; in vain they reproached my soul. Let a trap they do not know catch them, and they themselves shall fall into the same trap. But my soul shall greatly rejoice in the Lord; my soul shall delight in His salvation. All my bones shall say, \"O Lord, who is like You? You who deliver a poor man from hands stronger than he, and a poor and needy man from those who plunder him.\" Unjust witnesses rose up against me, asking me things I knew nothing about; they repaid me evil for good, and bereavement for my soul. But I put on sackcloth when they troubled me, and I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer will return into my bosom. Like a neighbor, like our brother, so they were well-pleasing; like one who laments and is of a sad countenance, so I humbled myself. But they were delighted, and were gathered together against me; whips were gathered together against me, but I did not know it; they were torn asunder, yet they were not pierced to the heart. They tempted me; they mocked and sneered at me; they gnashed their teeth at me. O Lord, when will You look on this? Restore my soul from their malice, my only-begotten from the lions. I will give thanks to You, O Lord, in the great church; I will praise You among a mighty people. Let them not rejoice over me, those who are unjustly my enemies, those who hate me without a cause, and wink with their eyes. For they spoke peace to me, but in their wrath they schemed deceit, and opened wide their mouth at me, saying, \"Well done! Well done! Our eyes saw it!\" You saw this, O Lord; do not keep silence; O Lord, do not be far from me. Arise, O Lord, attend to my judgment, my God and my Lord, to my cause. Judge me according to Your righteousness, O Lord my God, and let them not rejoice against me; let them not say in their hearts, \"Well done! Well done, our soul!\" Let them not say, \"We swallowed him up!\" May those who rejoice at my troubles be altogether dishonored and shamed; let those who boast against me be clothed with shame and humiliation. Let those who desire my righteousness greatly rejoice, and be glad, and let them say continually, \"The Lord be magnified,\" Those who desire His servant's peace.

psa36.text = "Do not be envious of those who do evil, nor be jealous of those who work lawlessness; for like grass they shall be dried up quickly, and like green vegetables they shall swiftly wither. Hope in the Lord, and work goodness; dwell in the land, and you shall be nurtured by its riches. Delight in the Lord, and He will give you the requests of your heart. Reveal your way to the Lord, and hope in Him; and He will do it. He shall bring forth your righteousness as light, and your judgment as the noonday sun. Submit to the Lord, and supplicate Him; do not be envious of him who prospers in his way, nor of him who transgresses the law. Cease from wrath and forsake anger; do not be envious so as to do evil; because evildoers will be destroyed, but those who wait on the Lord, these shall inherit the earth. For in a little while the sinner shall no longer be present, and you will look for his place, but not find it. But the gentle shall inherit the earth, and they will delight in the fullness of peace. The sinner will closely observe the just man and gnash at him with his teeth. But the Lord shall laugh at him, because He foresees his day will come. The sinners draw the sword and stretch their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to slay the upright in heart. May their sword enter their heart, and may their bows be shattered. Better the little with the just man than the great riches of sinners; for the arms of sinners shall be shattered, but the Lord supports the righteous. The Lord knows the ways of the blameless, and their inheritance shall be forever. They shall not be ashamed in an evil time, and in days of famine they shall be filled. But the sinners shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord altogether, when they glorify and exalt themselves; like smoke they shall vanish away. The sinner borrows, but will not repay; however, the righteous man is compassionate, and gives; for those who bless Him shall inherit the earth, but those who curse Him shall be utterly destroyed. The steps of a man are guided aright by the Lord, and he shall desire His way. When he falls, he shall not be broken to pieces, for the Lord supports him with His hand. I was young, but indeed I grew old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. Day in and out, he is merciful and lends, and his seed shall be a blessing. Turn away from evil, and do good, and dwell unto ages of ages; for the Lord loves judgment, and He will not abandon His holy ones; they shall be kept forever. But the lawless shall be banished, and the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. The righteous shall inherit the earth and dwell upon it unto ages of ages. The mouth of the righteous shall meditate on wisdom, and his tongue shall speak of judgment; the law of God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be tripped up. The sinner observes the righteous man and seeks to put him to death; but the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor condemn him, when He judges him. Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt you to inherit the earth; You shall see the sinners when they are utterly destroyed. I saw the ungodly greatly exalted and lifting himself up like the cedars of Lebanon; and I passed by, and behold, he was not; and I sought for him, but his place was not found. Keep innocence, and behold uprightness, for this is the remnant for the peaceful man. But transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together; the remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. Now the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord, and He is their protector in time of affliction; and the Lord shall help them, and deliver them; and He shall deliver them from sinners, and save them, because they hope in Him."

God shattered their teeth in their mouths; the Lord broke the teeth of the lions. They shall pass along like water running through; He will bend His bow until they are weakened. Like melting wax they will be destroyed; fire fell on them, and they never saw the sun. Before your thorns are aware of its prickly shrub, He will swallow you up, as if you were alive, as if in His anger. A righteous man shall be glad when he sees the vengeance of the ungodly; He shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner. A man will say, \"If indeed there is fruit for the righteous man, then it is God who judges them on the earth.\""

And let the righteous be glad; let them greatly rejoice before God; let them be glad with merriment. Sing to God; sing to His name; make ready the way for Him who rides upon the sunset; His name is the Lord; and greatly rejoice before Him. Let them be troubled before His face, He who is the father of orphans and the judge of widows; God is in His holy place. God settles the solitary in a house; with courage He leads out those in bondage, likewise those who rebel, who dwell in tombs. O God, when You went forth before Your people, when You passed through the desert, the earth shook; truly the heavens let the rain fall, before the face of the God of Sinai, before the face of the God of Israel. You, O God, willingly grant rain to Your inheritance, and it was weakened, but You restored it. Your creatures are dwelling in it; in Your goodness, O God, You provide for the poor. The Lord will give His word to those proclaiming the gospel with great power, He who is the King of hosts of the beloved, that He may divide the booty for the beauty of the house. If you fall asleep in the midst of your portions, You will have the wings of a dove, all covered with silver, and her back with yellow gold. When the heavenly One appoints kings over it, they shall become as white as the snow on Zalmon. The mountain of God is a fertile mountain, a mountain richly curdled with milk, a fat mountain. Why do you think about other mountains richly curdled with milk? This is the mountain God consented to dwell in; truly the Lord will lodge in it to the end. God's chariot is ten thousand-fold, thousands abounding in numbers; the Lord is among them at Sinai in the holy place. You ascended on high, You led captivity captive; You received gifts for mankind, truly for the disobedient, so they may dwell there. The Lord God is blessed; blessed is the Lord from day to day; the God of our salvation will bring prosperity upon us. Our God is the God who saves us, and the issues of death belong to the Lord's Lord. But God will crush the heads of His enemies, the hairy head of those who continue in their transgressions. The Lord said, \"I will return from Bashan; I will return in the depths of the sea, so your foot may be dipped in blood, the tongue of your dogs in the blood of your enemies.\" Your processionals were seen, O God, the processionals of my God and my King in the holy place. The rulers drew near, singers followed after; in the midst of them came young maidens playing timbrels. Bless God in the churches, the Lord from the fountains of Israel. There is the young Benjamin in ecstasy; the rulers of Judea are their leaders, the rulers of Zebulun and Naphtali. Give command, O God, to Your power; strengthen, O God, what You accomplished in us. Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, kings will bring gifts to You. Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed, the herd of bulls among the heifers of the peoples, lest they shut out those proven in silver; scatter the nations that desire wars. Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall draw near to stretch out its hand to God. Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth, sing to the Lord. Sing to God, who rides upon the heaven of heavens towards the east; behold, He will speak with His voice, a voice of power. Give glory to God; His magnificence is over Israel, and His power is in the clouds. God is wondrous in His saints; the God of Israel shall give power and strength to His people. Blessed is God."

I grow weary with crying; my throat is hoarse; my eyes fail me from hoping in my God. Those who hate me without a cause multiplied even more than the hairs of my head; my enemies who persecute me unjustly have become strong; then I paid for things I did not steal. O God, You know my foolishness, and my transgressions are not hidden from You. O Lord, O Lord of hosts, let not those who wait for You be put to shame because of me; O God of Israel, let not those who seek You feel ashamed because of me. For Your sake I bore disgrace; humiliation covered my face. I am become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's sons; for the zeal of Your house consumed me, and the insults of those who disgraced You fell on me. I bent down my soul with fasting, and it became a disgrace for me. I also made sackcloth my garment, and I became a byword to them. Those who sit at the gate were talking against me, and those who drink wine were singing about me. But I, O Lord, pray with my prayer to You; it is the time of Your goodwill, O God, in the abundance of Your mercies; in the truth of Your salvation, hear me. Save me from the mire, that I may not be stuck therein; deliver me from those who hate me, and from the depths of the waters. Let not a storm of water drown me; neither let the deep swallow me up, nor the well enclose its mouth upon me. Hear me, O Lord, for Your mercy is good; according to Your abundant compassion, look upon me. Turn not Your face from Your child, for I am afflicted; hear me speedily. Give heed to my soul, and redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies. For You know my disgrace and my shame and humiliation; all who afflict me are before You. My soul expected disgrace and trouble, and I waited for someone to sympathize with me; but no one was there, and for comforters, but I found not one. They gave me gall for my food, and they gave me vinegar for my drink. Let their table become a snare before them, and a recompense and a stumbling block. Let their eyes be darkened so they may not see, and bend down their backs continually; pour out Your anger upon them, and let the fury of Your wrath lay hold of them. Let their dwelling place be laid waste, and let no one live in their tents. For they pursued closely the one You slew, and they added to the pain of my wounds. Add lawlessness to their lawlessness, and let them not enter into Your righteousness; let them be blotted out from the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. I am poor and suffering, and the salvation of Your presence, O God, lays hold of me. I will praise God's name with a song; I will magnify Him in praise, and this shall be more pleasing to God than a young bull with horns and hooves. Let the poor behold this, and be glad; Seek God, and your soul shall live, for the Lord hears the poor, and does not despise His prisoners. Let heaven and earth praise Him, The seas and everything that moves in them. For God shall save Zion, and the cities of Judah shall be built; and they shall dwell therein, and inherit it; and the seed of His servants shall possess it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it."

Lift up Your hands against their arrogance to the end, against everything the enemy prostituted in Your holy places. Those Who hate You boasted in the midst of Your feast; They set up their signs, yes signs, and they did not know. As into an entrance hall, as in a thicket of trees, they cut down its doors with axes; With battle axes and hammers, they broke it down. They burned down Your sanctuary; They defiled the tabernacle of Your name to the ground. Their kindred said in their heart together, \"Come, let us abolish all the feasts of God from the earth.\" We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and He will no longer know us. How long, O God, will the enemy reproach? Will the adversary provoke Your name to the end? Why do You turn away Your hand, Your right hand from the midst of Your breast to the end? But God is our King before the ages; He worked salvation in the midst of the earth. You strengthened the sea by Your power; You crushed the heads of dragons upon the water. You shattered the heads of the dragon; You gave him as food for the Ethiopian peoples. You broke apart fountains and torrents; You dried up the rivers of Etham. The day is Yours, and the night is Yours; You created the light and the sun. You made all the boundaries of the earth; Summer and winter, You formed these things. Remember this: the enemy insulted the Lord, and a foolish people provoked Your name. May You not deliver to wild beasts the soul Who gives thanks to You; may You not forget the souls of Your poor to the end. Look upon Your covenant, for the dark places of the earth are filled with the houses of lawlessness. Let not the humbled and the disgraced be turned away; The poor and needy shall praise Your name.

psa77.text = "Give heed, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the words of my mouth; I shall open my mouth in parables; I shall speak of hidden things from of old. What things we heard, these we also knew, and our fathers described them to us. It was not hidden from their children in a different generation, Who declare the praises of the Lord and His mighty deeds and His wondrous things He did. He raised up a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, Whatever He commanded our fathers to make these things known to their children, that a different generation may know, Children yet to be born; and they will arise, and declare these things to their children, so they may put their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, and seek out His commandments, so they may not become like their fathers, a generation rebellious and embittered, a generation that did not keep its heart right, and its spirit was not faithful with God. The sons of Ephraim Who bend and shoot their bows Turned back in the day of battle. They did not keep God's covenant, and they did not desire to walk in His law; and they forgot His good deeds and His wonders He showed them In the sight of their fathers, The marvelous things He did In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. He parted the sea and led them through; The waters stood like a dam, and He led them with a cloud by day, and all night by the light of a fire. He split the rock in the desert and gave them water to drink as in a great deep; and He brought out water from the rock, and He brought it down like the waters of rivers. And they still continued to sin against Him; They rebelled against the Most High in a place without water, and they tested God in their hearts By asking food for their souls; and they slandered God and said, \"Why is God unable to prepare a table in the desert? Since He struck the rock, and waters flowed, and brooks flooded, Is He also unable to give us bread Or to prepare a table for His people?\" Therefore, the Lord heard and was enraged, and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath arose against Israel, because they did not believe in God, nor put their hope in His salvation. And He commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven; and He rained manna for them to eat and gave them the bread of heaven; Man ate the bread of angels; He sent them food in abundance. He took away the south wind from heaven, and with His power He brought in the southwest wind; He rained flesh on them like dust and winged birds like the sand of the sea, and they fell in the midst of their camp, all around their tents; and they ate and were well filled, and He brought them their own desire; They were not deprived of their desire. While their food was still in their mouth, The wrath of God rose up against them, and killed their wealthy ones and shackled Israel's chosen ones. In all these things they still sinned and did not believe in His wonders; and their days ended in folly and their years with haste. When He killed them, they sought Him out, and turned back, and rose up early before God; They remembered God was their helper, and the Most High God their redeemer. But they deceived Him with their mouth and lied to Him with their tongue, for their heart was not right with Him, neither were they faithful to His covenant. But He is merciful and will atone for their sins, and not destroy them; and He will multiply them, and turn away His anger; and He will not kindle all His wrath. for He remembered they are flesh, a spirit that is passing and not returning. How many times did they rebel against Him in the desert, and provoke Him to wrath in the desert? and they turned away and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. They did not remember His hand and the day He redeemed them from the hand of those afflicting them, How He wrought His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the plains of Zoan, and how He turned their rivers and rainfalls into blood, so they could not drink; He sent them the dog-fly, and it devoured them, and the frog, and it destroyed them. He gave their fruit to the mildew and their labors to the locust; He killed their vineyard with hail and their mulberry trees with frost; and He delivered their cattle to the hail and their property to the fire; He sent forth the wrath of His anger to them, anger and wrath and affliction, Sent forth through evil angels; He made a path for His wrath; He did not spare their souls from death, and their cattle He enclosed in death; and He struck every firstborn in Egypt, The firstfruit of their labor in the tents of Ham. And He brought His people out like sheep, and He led them like a flock in the desert; and He guided them in hope, and they were not afraid; and the sea covered up their enemies. He brought them into the mountain of His holiness, This mountain His right hand acquired; and He cast out the nations from before their face, and distributed them a measure of land as an inheritance; and He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. They tested and rebelled against the Most High God, and did not keep His testimonies; and they turned away and broke His covenant, just as their fathers did, and they changed into a crooked bow; and they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their carved images. God heard and despised them, and He utterly disdained Israel; and He rejected the tabernacle at Shiloh, His dwelling place, where He settled among men. He gave their strength into captivity and their beauty into the hands of the enemy; and He gave His people over to the sword and despised His inheritance. Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins were not lamented; their priests fell by the sword, and their widows were not lamented. Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man drunk from wine; and He struck His enemies from behind; He gave them eternal reproach. And He rejected the dwelling of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; He chose the tribe of Judah, This Mount Zion that He loves; and He built His sanctuary as the place of unicorns; He founded it forever on the earth. He chose David for His servant and took him from the sheepfolds; He took him from behind sheep that gave birth to shepherd Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance; and he shepherded them in the integrity of his heart and guided them with the skillfulness of his hands."

O Lord my God, You are magnified exceedingly; You clothe Yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment, Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain; You are He Who covers His upper chambers with water, Who makes the clouds His means of approach, Who walks on the wings of the winds, Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire. He established the earth on its stable foundation; It shall not be moved unto ages of ages. The deep like a garment is His covering; the waters shall stand upon the mountains; at Your rebuke they shall flee; at the sound of Your thunder, they shall be afraid. The mountains rise up, and the plains sink down to the place You founded for them. You set a boundary they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth. You are He Who sends springs into the valley; the waters shall pass between the mountains; they shall give drink to all the wild animals of the field; the wild asses shall quench their thirst; the birds of heaven shall dwell beside them; they shall sing from the midst of the rocks. You are He Who waters the mountains from His higher places; the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of Your works. You are He Who causes grass to grow for the cattle, and the green plant for the service of man, to bring forth bread from the earth; and wine gladdens the heart of man, to brighten his face with oil; and bread strengthens man's heart. The trees of the plain shall be full of fruit, the cedars of Lebanon, which You planted; there the sparrows shall make their nests; the house of the heron takes the lead among them. The high mountains are for the deer; the cliff is a refuge for the rabbits. He made the moon for seasons; the sun knows its setting. You established darkness, and it was night, wherein all the wild animals of the forest will prowl about; the young lions roar and snatch their prey, and seek their food from God. The sun arises, and they are gathered together; and they shall be put to bed in their dens. Man shall go out to his work and to his labor until evening. O Lord, Your works shall be magnified greatly; You made all things in wisdom; the earth was filled with Your creation. There is this great and spacious sea: the creeping things are there without number; the living things are there, both small and great; there the ships pass through; there is this dragon You formed to play therein. All things wait upon You, that You may give them food in due season. When You give it to them, they shall gather it; when You open Your hand, all things shall be filled with Your goodness. But when You turn Your face away, they shall be troubled; when You take away their breath, they shall die and return again to their dust. You shall send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created, and You shall renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord be forever; the Lord shall be glad in His works; He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble; He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing to my God as long as I exist; may my words be pleasing to Him, and I shall be glad in the Lord. May sinners cease from the earth, and the lawless, so as to be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul."

psa105.text = "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever. Who shall tell the mighty deeds of the Lord, Who shall make all His praises heard? Blessed are those who keep His judgment, and do righteousness at all times. Remember us, O Lord, because of the goodwill of Your people; Visit us with Your salvation, so as to see it in the goodness of Your chosen ones; so as to be glad with the joy of Your nation, so as to praise You in the midst of Your inheritance. We sinned with our fathers; We committed lawlessness; we acted wrongfully. Our fathers did not understand Your wonders in Egypt; They did not remember the multitude of Your mercy, But rebelled when they went up to the Red Sea. But He saved them because of His name, so they might know His power; and He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them in the sea as though it were a desert. He saved them from the hands of those who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy; so the water covered those who afflicted them; there was not one left among them. Then they believed His words and sang His praise. They were quick to forget His works; They did not wait for His counsel; and they desired exceedingly in the desert, and tempted God in a waterless place. So He gave them their request and fully satisfied their souls. They also angered Moses in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord; The earth was opened and swallowed Dathan, and buried the assembly of Abiram; a fire kindled in their assembly; The flame burned up the sinners. They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed down and worshiped the graven image; Thus they changed their glory Into the likeness of a calf that eats grass. They forgot the God who saved them, Who did great things in Egypt, and marvelous things in the land of Ham, fearful things at the Red Sea. And He said He would destroy them Had not Moses His chosen one Stood among them in the destruction before Him, to turn away His wrath so as not to destroy them. Then they despised the desired land; They did not believe His word, But murmured in their tents; They did not listen to the Lord's voice. So He raised His hand against them, to overthrow them in the desert; and to overthrow their seed among the nations, and to scatter them among the countries. They were consecrated to Baal-Peor, and ate sacrifices of the dead; so they provoked Him with their ways of living, and destruction multiplied among them. Then Phinehas stood among them and made atonement, and the destruction ceased; and it was reckoned as righteousness to him From generation to generation forever. They also provoked Him to anger at the water of Rebellion, and Moses was afflicted because of them; for they embittered his spirit, and he spoke offensively with his lips; They did not destroy the nations the Lord said to destroy, But mingled with the nations and learned their works; and they served their graven images, and this became a snare for them; They also sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons, and shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan; so the land was polluted with their blood; It was also defiled by their works; Thus they acted unfaithfully in their ways of living. And the Lord was very angry with His people, and He abhorred His inheritance; Then He delivered them into the hands of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them. Their enemies also afflicted them, and they were humbled under their hands. He delivered them many times, But they rebelled against Him with their counsel, and were humbled by their transgressions. And He saw them in their afflictions; He listened to their supplications, and He remembered His covenant, and felt regret according to the multitude of His mercy; so He aroused compassion for them Among all who made them captives. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, so we may give thanks to Your holy name, and boast in Your praise. Bless the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. And all the people shall say, \"Amen! Amen!\""

psa106.text = "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever. Let those redeemed by the Lord say so, Whom He redeemed from the hand of the enemy. He gathered them from the countries, from the east and the west and the north and the south. They were led astray in the desert, in a place without water; They did not find a road to an inhabited city; While hungering and thirsting, their soul fainted in them; and they cried out to the Lord in their affliction, and He delivered them from their distresses; and He led them in a straight path, so they might go to a city of habitation. Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies and His wonders to the sons of men; for He fed the empty soul and filled the hungry soul with good things, those sitting in the darkness and shadow of death, Bound in poverty and fetters; for they rebelled against the teachings of God and provoked the counsel of the Most High; Thus their heart was humbled by troubles; They were weak, and there was no one to help them; Then they cried out to the Lord in their afflictions, and He saved them from their distresses; and He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their chains to pieces. Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies, His wonders to the sons of men; for He crushed the gates of bronze and shattered the bars of iron. He helped them out of their lawless ways, for they were humbled because of their transgressions. Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near the gates of death; Then they cried to the Lord in their afflictions, and He saved them from their distresses; He sent His Word and healed them, and delivered them from their corruptions. Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies and His wonders to the sons of men, and let them offer a sacrifice of praise; and let them proclaim His works with exceeding joy. Those who go down to the sea in ships, Who do business in many waters, These see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep; He spoke, and a stormy wind arose, and its waves were lifted up; They mount up to the heavens and descend into the deep; their soul is consumed with evils; They were troubled; they were shaken like one drunk with wine, and all their wisdom was consumed; Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and He brought them out of their distresses. He also commanded the storm, and it became a breeze, and its waves were still; Then they were glad, for they were silent, and He guided them to the haven of their desire. Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercies and His wonders to the sons of men; let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the seat of the elders. He turned rivers into a desert and streams of water into dry ground, a fruitful land into salt water, because of the evils of those living there. He turned the desert into pools of water, and a land without water into streams of water; Then He caused the hungry to dwell there and established a city for habitation; They sowed fields and planted vineyards, and produced much fruit; so He blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly, and their cattle did not diminish. But they were diminished and maltreated By the affliction of evils and pain. Contempt was poured out on princes, and He made them wander in an impassible place, where there was no road. Yet He helped the poor man out of his poverty, and made his families like a flock. The righteous shall see this and be glad, and all lawlessness shall stop its mouth. Who is wise and shall keep these things, and shall understand the mercies of the Lord?"

Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me, But I continued to pray; so they repaid me evil for good, and hatred for my love. Set a sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand. And when he is judged, may he go forth condemned, and let his prayer become sin. Let his days be very few, and may a different man receive his office; let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children wander about and be beggars; let them be cast out of their houses. Let the creditor search out whatever possessions he has; let strangers plunder his labors; let there be no helper for him, nor a compassionate one for his fatherless children; let his children be utterly destroyed; in a single generation, let his name be blotted out. May the lawlessness of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and may the sin of his mother not be blotted out; let them be continually before the Lord, and may the remembrance of them be utterly destroyed from the earth, because he did not remember to show mercy, But persecuted a poor and needy man, and one pierced to the heart, that he might kill him. And he loved cursing, and it came to him, and he did not desire blessing, so it shall be far from him. So he clothed himself with cursing like a garment, and it entered like water into his bowels and like oil into his bones; let it be for him like a garment that clothes him, and like a belt that girds him continually. This is the work of those who falsely accuse me before the Lord, and of those who speak evil things against my soul. But You, O Lord, O Lord, deal mercifully with me for Your name's sake, for Your mercy is good. Save me, for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me. I was removed like a shadow when it declines; I was shaken off like the locusts. My knees were weak from fasting, and my flesh was changed because of the oil. And I became an object of reproach to them; They saw me; they shook their heads. Help me, O Lord my God; Save me according to Your mercy; Then let them know this is Your hand, and You, O Lord, did this. They themselves shall curse, but You shall bless; let those who rise up against me be put to shame, But let Your servant be glad. Let those who falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them be covered with their dishonor like a double cloak. I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth, and in the midst of many I will praise Him, because He stood at the right hand of a poor man, to save me from those who persecute my soul."

Let the house of Aaron say that He is good, for His mercy endures forever. Let all who fear the Lord say that He is good, for His mercy endures forever. In affliction I called upon the Lord, and He heard me in a broad place. The Lord is my helper; I shall not be afraid of what man will do to me. The Lord is my helper; I shall look upon my enemies. It is good to trust in the Lord Rather than to trust in man; It is good to hope in the Lord Rather than to hope in rulers. All the nations surrounded me, But in the name of the Lord I defended myself against them; They circled and surrounded me, But in the name of the Lord I defended myself against them; They surrounded me like bees around a honeycomb, and they were inflamed like fire in a thorn bush; But in the name of the Lord I defended myself against them. I was shoved and disheartened, that I might fall, But the Lord took hold of me. The Lord is my strength and my song, and He became my salvation. The sound of exceeding joy and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of the Lord worked its power; The right hand of the Lord exalted me; The right hand of the Lord worked its power. I shall not die, but live, and tell of the Lord's works. The Lord chastened and corrected me, But He did not give me up to death. Open the gates of righteousness to me; I will enter therein and give thanks to the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord; The righteous shall go in through it. I will give thanks to You, for You heard me, and You became my salvation. The stone the builders rejected, the same became the head of the corner; and this came about from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes. This is the day the Lord made; let us greatly rejoice, and be glad therein. O Lord, save us now; O Lord, prosper us now. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; We blessed you from the house of the Lord.

For those who work lawlessness Do not walk in His ways. You commanded us regarding Your commandments, That we should be very diligent to keep them. Would that my ways were led, That I might keep Your ordinances. Then I would not be ashamed When I regard all Your commandments. I will give thanks to You, O Lord, with an upright heart, When I learn the judgments of Your righteousness. I shall keep Your ordinances; Do not utterly forsake me. How shall a young man keep his way straight? When he keeps Your words. I searched for You with my whole heart; Do not drive me away from Your commandments. I hid Your teachings in my heart So as not to sin against You. Blessed are You, O Lord; Teach me Your ordinances. With my lips I declared All the judgments of Your mouth. I delight in the way of Your testimonies As much as in all riches. I shall meditate on Your commandments, And I shall understand Your ways. I shall meditate on Your ordinances; I shall not forget Your words. Reward Your servant; I shall live, and keep Your words. Unveil my eyes, And I shall understand the wonders in Your law. I am a sojourner on the earth; Do not hide Your commandments from me. My soul longed to desire Your judgments in every season. You rebuke the arrogant; Those who turn aside from Your commandments are accursed. Take away reproach and contempt from me, For I searched Your testimonies. For rulers sat and spoke against me, But Your servant meditated on Your ordinances. For Your testimonies are my meditation, And Your ordinances are my counsels. My soul cleaves to the earth; Give me life according to Your word. I made known my ways and You heard me; Teach me Your ordinances. Cause me to understand the way of Your ordinances, And I shall meditate on Your wonders. My soul fainted because of its listlessness; Establish me in Your words. Remove the way of unrighteousness from me, And with Your law have mercy on me. I chose the way of truth; I have not forgotten Your judgments. I cleave to Your testimonies; O Lord, do not disappoint me. I ran on the path of Your commandments, When You enlarged my heart. Give me as law, O Lord, the way of Your ordinances, And I shall always search them. Cause me to understand, and I shall search out Your law; And I shall keep it with my whole heart. Guide me in the path of Your commandments, For I desire it. Incline my heart to Your testimonies And not to greediness. Turn away my eyes that I may not see vanity; Give me life in Your way. Establish Your teaching in Your servant In regard to Your fear. Take away my blame, which I have suspected, For Your judgments are good. Behold, I long for Your commandments; Give me life in Your righteousness. And may Your mercy come upon me, O Lord, Your salvation according to Your teaching. And I shall answer those who insult me with a word, For I hope in Your words. Do not take away the word of truth completely from my mouth, For I hope in Your judgments. So I shall keep Your law always, Forever and unto ages of ages. And I walk in a broad space, For I searched Your commandments. I spoke of Your testimonies Before kings, and I was not ashamed. And I meditate on Your commandments, Which I love exceedingly. And I raise my hands to Your commandments, which I love, And I meditate on Your ordinances. Remember Your word to Your servant, In which You give me hope. This comforted me in my humiliation, For Your teaching gives me life. The arrogant transgressed exceedingly, But I did not turn away from Your law. I remembered Your judgments of old, O Lord, And I was comforted. Despondency held me because of sinners Who abandon Your law. Your ordinances were sung to me In the place of my sojourning. I remembered Your name in the night, O Lord, And I kept Your law. This happened to me in the night, Because I searched Your ordinances. You are my portion, O Lord; I said I will keep Your law. I sought Your presence with my whole heart; Have mercy on me according to Your teaching. I considered Your ways, And I turned my feet toward Your testimonies. I prepared myself, and I was not troubled, That I might keep Your commandments. The ropes of sinners ensnared me, But I did not forget Your law. At midnight I arose to give thanks to You Because of the judgments of Your righteousness. I am a companion of all who fear You And keep Your commandments. O Lord, the earth is full of Your mercy; Teach me Your ordinances. O Lord, You dealt with Your servant in goodness, According to Your word. Teach me goodness, instruction, and knowledge, For I believe Your commandments. Before I was humbled, I transgressed; Therefore, I kept Your teaching. You are good, O Lord, and in Your goodness Teach me Your ordinances. The unrighteousness of the arrogant multiplied against me, But I will search out Your commandments with my whole heart. Their heart was curdled like milk, But I meditated on Your law. It is good for me that You humbled me, That I might learn Your ordinances.

Let Your compassions come to me, and I shall live; For Your law is my meditation. Let the arrogant be shamed, for they transgressed unjustly against me; But I shall meditate on Your commandments. Let those who fear You turn to me, And those who know Your testimonies. Let my heart be blameless in Your ordinances, That I may not be disappointed. My soul earnestly longs for Your salvation, And I hope in Your word. My eyes strained to look at Your teaching, Saying, “When will You comfort me?” I am like a leather bag in a frost; I did not forget Your ordinances. How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment for me upon those who persecute me? Transgressors described their meditations to me, But these are not like Your law, O Lord. All Your commandments are truth; They persecuted me unjustly; help me. They almost ended my life on earth, But I did not forsake Your commandments. Give me life according to Your mercy, And I shall keep the testimonies of Your mouth. Forever, O Lord, Your word continues in heaven. Your truth continues from generation to generation; You laid the foundation of the earth, and it continues. By Your arrangement each day continues, For all things are Your servants.

I understand more than the elders, For I search Your commandments. I withheld my feet from every evil way, That I might keep Your words. I did not turn away from Your judgments, For You taught me Your law. How sweet to my taste are Your teachings, More than honey and the honeycomb in my mouth. I gained understanding because of Your commandments; Therefore, I hate every unrighteous way. Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my paths. I swore and confirmed That I would keep the judgments of Your righteousness. I was humbled exceedingly; O Lord, give me life according to Your word. Be well-pleased with the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, And teach me Your judgments. My soul is always in Your hands, And I have not forgotten Your law. Sinners set snares for me, But I did not wander from Your commandments. I inherited Your testimonies forever, For these are the exceeding joy of my heart. I inclined my heart to do Your ordinances Forever for a reward. Transgressors I hate, But I love Your law. You are my helper and my protector; I hope in Your word. Turn away from me, you evildoers, And I shall search out the commandments of my God. Uphold me according to Your teaching, and give me life; And may You not disappoint my expectation. Help me, and I shall be saved; And I shall meditate always in Your ordinances. You set at naught all who departed from Your ordinances, For their thought is unrighteous. I counted as transgressors all the sinners of the earth; For this reason I always love Your testimonies. Nail my flesh with the fear of You, For I fear You because of Your judgments. I work judgment and righteousness; Do not deliver me to those who wrong me. Take Your servant to that which is good; Do not let the arrogant falsely accuse me. My eyes strained to look at Your salvation And at the teaching of Your righteousness. Deal with Your servant according to Your mercy And teach me Your ordinances. I am Your servant; cause me to understand, And I shall know Your testimonies. It is time for the Lord to act; They broke Your law. For this reason I love Your commandments More than gold and topaz. Therefore I directed myself to all Your commandments; I hated every unrighteous way. Wondrous are Your testimonies; For this reason my soul searches them out. The revelation of Your words gives light, And it causes children to understand. I opened my mouth and drew in my breath, For I longed for Your commandments."

My eyes poured down streams of tears Because they did not keep Your law. Righteous are You, O Lord, And upright is Your judgment. You commanded Your testimonies exceedingly In righteousness and truth. The zeal of Your house caused me to yearn for home, For my enemies forgot Your words. Your teaching is exceedingly purified in fire, And Your servant loves it. I am young, and beheld as nothing, But I have not forgotten Your ordinances. Your righteousness is righteousness forever, And Your law is truth. Affliction and trouble found me, But Your commandments are my meditation. Your testimonies are righteousness forever; Give me understanding, and I shall live. I cry out with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord; I shall search Your ordinances. I cry out to You; save me, And I shall keep Your testimonies. I arose at midnight and cried out; I hoped in Your words. My eyes awoke before dawn That I might meditate on Your teachings. Hear my voice, O Lord, according to Your mercy; Give me life according to Your judgment. Those who persecute me in lawlessness drew near; They are far removed from Your law. You are near, O Lord; All Your commandments are truth. From the beginning I knew Your testimonies, That You established them forever. Behold my humiliation and deliver me, For I have not forgotten Your law. Plead my cause and redeem me; Give me life because of Your word. Salvation is far from sinners, For they have not searched Your ordinances. Your compassions are many, O Lord; Give me life according to Your judgment. Many are those who pursue and afflict me, But I did not turn away from Your testimonies. I saw those acting foolishly, and I yearned for You; For they did not keep Your teachings. Behold, I love Your commandments; O Lord, in Your mercy, give me life. The beginning of Your words is truth, And all the judgments of Your righteousness are forever. Rulers persecuted me without cause, But my heart feared because of Your words. I shall greatly rejoice in Your teachings, Like one finding great spoil. I hate and abhor unrighteousness, But I love Your law. I praise You seven times a day For the judgments of Your righteousness. Great peace have all who love Your law, And it is not an offense to them. I long for Your salvation, O Lord, And I love Your commandments. My soul keeps Your testimonies, And I love them exceedingly. I keep Your commandments and Your testimonies, For all my ways are before You, O Lord. Let my supplication draw near before You, O Lord; Give me understanding according to Your teaching. May my petition come before You; Deliver me according to Your teaching. My lips shall overflow in song When You teach me Your ordinances. My tongue shall speak of Your teaching, For all Your commandments are righteousness. Let Your hand be for saving me, For I chose Your commandments. I long for Your salvation, O Lord, And Your law is my meditation. My soul shall live and praise You, And Your judgments shall help me.
