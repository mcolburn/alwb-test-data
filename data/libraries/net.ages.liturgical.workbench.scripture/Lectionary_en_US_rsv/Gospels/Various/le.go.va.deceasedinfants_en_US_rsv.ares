But Jesus called them to him, saying, \"Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.\" Those who heard it said, \"Then who can be saved?\" But he said, \"What is impossible with men is possible with God.\""
