leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, \"Why do the disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?\" And Jesus said to them, \"Can you make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.\" He told them a parable also: \"No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does, he will tear the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.' \""
