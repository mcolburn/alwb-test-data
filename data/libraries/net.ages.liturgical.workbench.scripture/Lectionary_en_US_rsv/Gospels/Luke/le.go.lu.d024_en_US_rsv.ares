And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger. And they went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we are perishing!\" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm. He said to them, \"Where is your faith?\" And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, \"Who then is this, that he commands even wind and water, and they obey him?\""
