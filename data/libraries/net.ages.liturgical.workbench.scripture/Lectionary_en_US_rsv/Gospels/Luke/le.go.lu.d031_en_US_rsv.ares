leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples, \"Let these words sink into your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered in to the hands of men.\" But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. And an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. But when Jesus perceived the thought of their hearts, he took a child and put him by his side, and said to them, \"Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me; for he who is least among you all is the one who is great.\" John answered, \"Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.\" But Jesus said to him, \"Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.\""
