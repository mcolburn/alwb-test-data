leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, \"What were you discussing on the way?\" But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest. And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, \"If any one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.\" And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them, \"Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.\" John said to him, \"Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he was not following us.\" But Jesus said, \"Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is for us. For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.\""
