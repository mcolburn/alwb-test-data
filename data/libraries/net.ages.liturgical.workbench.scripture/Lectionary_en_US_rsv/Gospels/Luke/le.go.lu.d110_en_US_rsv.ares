leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, \"Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!\" And Jesus said to him, \"Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.\" And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, \"Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign when these things are all to be accomplished?\" And Jesus began to say to them, \"Take heed that no one leads you astray. Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray. And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the sufferings.\""
