leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit for forty days in the wilderness, tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry. The devil said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, command the stone to become bread.\" And Jesus answered him, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.' \" And the devil took him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, \"To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I will give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.\" And Jesus answered him, \"It is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.' \" And he took him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, \"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here; for it is written, 'He will give his angels charge of you, to guard you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.' \" And Jesus answered him, \"It is said, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.' \" And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time. And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and a report concerning him went out through all the surrounding country. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all."
