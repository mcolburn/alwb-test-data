leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, there came to Jesus a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet he besought him to come to his house, for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. As he went, the people pressed round him. And a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years and had spent all her living upon physicians and could not be healed by anyone, came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood ceased. And Jesus said, \"Who was it that touched me?\" When all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!\" But Jesus said, \"Some one touched me; for I perceive that power has gone forth from me.\" And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed. And he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.\" While he was still speaking, a man from the ruler's house came and said, \"Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.\" But Jesus on hearing this answered him, \"Do not fear; only believe, and she shall be well.\" And when he came to the house, he permitted no one to enter with him, except Peter and John and James, and the father and mother of the child. And all were weeping and bewailing her; but he said, \"Do not weep; for she is not dead but sleeping.\" And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. But taking her by the hand he called, saying, \"Child, arise.\" And her spirit returned, and she got up at once; and he directed that something should be given her to eat. And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell no one what had happened."
