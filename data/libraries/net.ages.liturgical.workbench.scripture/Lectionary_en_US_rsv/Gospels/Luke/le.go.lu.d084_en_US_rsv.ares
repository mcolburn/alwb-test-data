leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus entered a village, He was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices and said: \"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.\" When He saw them He said to them, \"Go and show yourselves to the priests.\" And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus's feet, giving Him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then said Jesus: \"Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" And He said to him: \"Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\""
