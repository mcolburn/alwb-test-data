leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they besought him for her. And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she rose and served them. Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. And demons also came out of many, crying, \"You are the Son of God!\" But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. And when it was day he departed and went into a lonely place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them; but he said to them, \"I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also; for I was sent for this purpose.\" And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee."
