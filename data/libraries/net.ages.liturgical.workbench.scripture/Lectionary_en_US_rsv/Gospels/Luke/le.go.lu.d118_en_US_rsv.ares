leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples, \"Beware of the scribes, who like to go about in long robes, and love salutations in the market places and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.\" He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury; and he saw a poor widow put in two copper coins. And he said, \"Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; for they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all the living that she had.\" Having said this, he proclaimed, \"He who has ears let him hear.\""
