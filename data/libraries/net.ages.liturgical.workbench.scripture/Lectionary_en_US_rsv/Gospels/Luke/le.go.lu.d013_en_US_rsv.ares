leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him to heal. And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus; but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus. And when he saw their faith he said, \"Man, your sins are forgiven you.\" And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, \"Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?\" When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, \"Why do you question in your hearts? Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins\"—he said to the man who was paralyzed—\"I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.\" And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he lay, and went home, glorifying God. And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, \"We have seen strange things today.\""
