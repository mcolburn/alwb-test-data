leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the sabbath; and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, \"Ah! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God.\" But Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be silent, and come out of him!\" And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. And they were all amazed and said to one another, \"What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.\""
