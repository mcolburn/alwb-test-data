leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaios, a blind beggar, the son of Timaios, was sitting by the roadside. And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" And Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" And they called the blind man, saying to him, \"Take heart; rise, he is calling you.\" And throwing off his mantle he sprang up and came to Jesus. And Jesus said to him, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" And the blind man said to him, \"Master, let me receive my sight.\" And Jesus said to him, \"Go your way; your faith has made you well.\" And immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way."
