leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, while Jesus was teaching one of the multitude said to him, \"Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.\" But he said to him, \"Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?\" And he said to them, \"Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" And he said to his disciples, \"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat, nor about your body, what you shall put on. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of life? If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? Consider. the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O men of little faith! And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be of anxious mind. For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things shall be yours as well.\""
