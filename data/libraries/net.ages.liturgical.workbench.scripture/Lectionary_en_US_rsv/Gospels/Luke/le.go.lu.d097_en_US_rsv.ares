leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said, \"He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much. If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.\" The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him. But he said to them, \"You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.\""
