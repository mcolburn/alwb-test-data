leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, one of Jesus' disciples came to him and said, \"Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.\" But Jesus said to him, \"Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.\" When the days drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him; but the people would not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \"Lord, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them?\" But he turned and rebuked them. And they went on to another village."
