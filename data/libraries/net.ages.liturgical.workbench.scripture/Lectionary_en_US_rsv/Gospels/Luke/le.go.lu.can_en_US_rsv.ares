leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried, \"Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely possessed by a demon.\" But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, \"Send her away, for she is crying after us.\" He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" But she came and knelt before him, saying, \"Lord, help me.\" And he answered, \"It is not fair to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" She said, \"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.\" Then Jesus answered her, \"O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\" And her daughter was healed instantly."
