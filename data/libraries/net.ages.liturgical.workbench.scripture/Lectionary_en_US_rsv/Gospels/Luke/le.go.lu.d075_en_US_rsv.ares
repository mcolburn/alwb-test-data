leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the scribes and the chief priests tried to lay hands on him at that very hour, but they feared the people; for they perceived that he had told this parable against them. So they watched him, and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might take hold of what he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. They asked him, \"Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\" But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, \"Show me a coin. Whose likeness and inscription has it?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said; but marveling at his answer they were silent."
