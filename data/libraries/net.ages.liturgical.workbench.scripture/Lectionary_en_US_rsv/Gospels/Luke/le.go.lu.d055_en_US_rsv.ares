leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. And behold, a man from the crowd cried, \"Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child; and behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him till he foams, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.\" Jesus answered, \"O faithless and perverse generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.\" While he was coming the demon tore him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. And all were astonished at the majesty of God."
