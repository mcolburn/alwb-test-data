And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, \"Do you see anything?\" And he looked up and said, \"I see men; but they look like trees, walking.\" Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes; and he looked intently and was restored, and saw everything clearly. And he sent him away to his home, saying, \"Do not even enter the village.\""
