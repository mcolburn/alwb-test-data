lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David.\" When he entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?\" They said to him, \"Yes, Lord.\" Then he touched their eyes, saying, \"According to your faith be it done to you.\" And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them, \"See that no one knows it.\" But they went away and spread his fame through all that district. As they were going away, behold, a dumb demoniac was brought to him. And when the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, \"Never was anything like this seen in Israel.\" But the Pharisees said, \"He casts out demons by the prince of demons.\" And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people."
