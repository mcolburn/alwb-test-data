And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. And they went and woke him, saying, \"Save us, O Lord; we are perishing.\" And he said to them, \"Why are you afraid, O men of little faith?\" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. And the men marveled, saying, \"What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?\""
