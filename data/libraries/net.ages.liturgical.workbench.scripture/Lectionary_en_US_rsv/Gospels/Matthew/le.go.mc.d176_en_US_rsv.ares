lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick. When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, \"This is a lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\" Jesus said, \"They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"We have only five loaves here and two fish.\" And he said, \"Bring them here to me.\" Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke and gave the loaves to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. Then he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds."
