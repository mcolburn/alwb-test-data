lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever; he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him. That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.\" Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. And a scribe came up and said to him, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\" And Jesus said to him, \"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.\" Another of the disciples said to him, \"Lord, let me first go and bury my father.\" But Jesus said to him, \"Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.\" And when he entered the boat, his disciples followed him."
