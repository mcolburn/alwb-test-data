lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men. Tell us, then, what do you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\" But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, \"Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the money for the tax.\" And they brought him a coin. And Jesus said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\" They said, \"Caesar's.\" Then he said to them, \"Render, therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\" When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away."
