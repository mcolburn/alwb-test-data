And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him, \"Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.\" And he replied, \"Who are my mother and my brothers?\" And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.\""
