lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, \"It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer'; but you make it a den of robbers.\" And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there. In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the wayside he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\""
