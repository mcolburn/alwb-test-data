lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a young man came up to Jesus, kneeling and saying, \"Good Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?\" And he said to him, \"Why do you call me good? One there is who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.\" He said to him, \"Which?\" And Jesus said, \"You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" The young man said to him, \"All these I have observed; what do I still lack?\" Jesus said to him, \"If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.\" When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples, \"Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, \"Who then can be saved?\" But Jesus looked at them and said to them, \"With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\""
