lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus came to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, two demoniacs met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one would pass that way. And behold, they cried out, \"What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?\" Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them. And the demons begged him, \"If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.\" And he said to them, \"Go.\" So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters. The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs. And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood. And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city."
