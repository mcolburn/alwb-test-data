lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples came and said to him, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?\" He answered, \"Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\" But Peter said to him, \"Explain the parable to us.\" And he said, \"Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and so passes on? But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.\" And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon."
