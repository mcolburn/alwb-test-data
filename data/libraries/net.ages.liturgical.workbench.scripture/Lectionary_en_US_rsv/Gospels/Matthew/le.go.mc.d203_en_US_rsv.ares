And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David!\" The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent; but they cried out the more, \"Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!\" And Jesus stopped and called them, saying, \"What do you want me to do for you?\" They said to him, \"Lord, let our eyes be opened.\" And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him."
