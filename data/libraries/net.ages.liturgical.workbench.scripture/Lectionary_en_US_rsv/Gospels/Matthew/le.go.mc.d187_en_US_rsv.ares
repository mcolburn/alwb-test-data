And he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; but when it falls on any one, it will crush him.\" When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him to be a prophet."
