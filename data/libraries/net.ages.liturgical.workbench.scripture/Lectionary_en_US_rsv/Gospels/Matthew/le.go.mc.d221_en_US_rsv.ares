lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus called to him his twelve disciples and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. And he said to them, \"Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.\" So they went out and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them."
