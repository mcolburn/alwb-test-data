lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.\" He told them another parable. \"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.\" All this Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed he said nothing to them without a parable. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.\" Then he left the crowds and went into the house."
