lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, while Jesus was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. But he replied to the man who told him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and sister, and mother.\" That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. And great crowds gathered about him, so that he entered a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables."
