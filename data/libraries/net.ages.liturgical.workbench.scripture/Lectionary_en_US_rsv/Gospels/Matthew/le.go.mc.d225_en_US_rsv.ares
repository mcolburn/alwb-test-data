This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.\" Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, \"What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he?\" They said to him, \"The son of David.\" He said to them, \"How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put your enemies under your feet'? If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?\" And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions."
