lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus to point out to him the buildings of the temple. But he answered them, \"You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.\" As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, \"Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Take heed that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying 'I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray.' And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places: all this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. And then many will fall away, and betray one another, and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because wickedness is multiplied, most men's love will grow cold. But he who endures to the end will be saved.\""
