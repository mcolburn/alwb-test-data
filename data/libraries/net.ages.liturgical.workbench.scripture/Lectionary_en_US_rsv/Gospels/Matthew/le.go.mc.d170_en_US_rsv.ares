lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. He answered them, \"When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather; for the sky is red.' And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.\" So he left them and departed. When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread. Jesus said to them, \"Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\""
