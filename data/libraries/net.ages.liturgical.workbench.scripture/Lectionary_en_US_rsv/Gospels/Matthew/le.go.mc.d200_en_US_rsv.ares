I know who you are, the Holy One of God.\" But Jesus rebuked him, saying, \"Be silent, and come out of him!\" And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, \"What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.\" And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee."
