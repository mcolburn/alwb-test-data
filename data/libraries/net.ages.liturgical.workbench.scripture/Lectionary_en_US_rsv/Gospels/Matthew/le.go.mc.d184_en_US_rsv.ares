And he said to it, \"May no fruit ever come from you again!\" And the fig tree withered at once. When the disciples saw it they marveled, saying, \"How did the fig tree wither at once?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and never doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done. And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.\""
