From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?\" And when he said, \"From others,\" Jesus said to him, \"Then the sons are free. However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.\" At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them, and said, \"Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\""
