lemcVE.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: \"You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of man will be delivered up to be crucified.\" Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and took counsel together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. But they said, \"Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people.\" Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head, as he sat at table. But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, \"Why this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for a large sum, and given to the poor.\" But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, \"Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. In pouring this ointment on my body she has done it to prepare me for burial. Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\" Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, \"What will you give me if I deliver him to you?\" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him. Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, \"Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?\" He said, \"Go into the city to a certain one, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.'\" And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover. When it was evening, he sat at table with the twelve disciples; Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God, rose from supper, laid aside his garments, and girded himself with a towel. Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. He came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him, \"Lord, do you wash my feet?\" Jesus answered him, \"What I am doing you do not know now, but afterward you will understand.\" Peter said to him, \"You shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him, \"If I do not wash you, you have no part in me.\" Simon Peter said to him, \"Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!\" Jesus said to him, \"He who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but he is clean all over; and you are clean, but not every one of you.\" For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, \"You are not all clean.\" When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and resumed his place, he said to them, \"Do you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.\" And as they were eating, he said, \"Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.\" And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, \"Is it I, Lord?\" He answered, \"He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me, will betray me. The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" Judas, who betrayed him, said, \"Is it I, Master?\" He said to him, \"You have said so.\" Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, \"Take, eat; this is my body.\" And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, \"Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\" And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, \"You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" Peter declared to him, \"Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.\" Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.\" Peter said to him, \"Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.\" And so said all the disciples. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here, while I go yonder and pray.\" And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.\" And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, \"My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.\" And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, \"So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, \"My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done.\" And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.\" While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, \"The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.\" And he came up to Jesus at once and said, \"Hail, Master!\" And he kissed him. Jesus said to him, \"Friend, why are you here?\" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, \"Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?\" At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said, \"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'\" And the high priest stood up and said, \"Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?\" But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, \"I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" Jesus said to him, \"You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" Then the high priest tore his robes, and said, \"He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?\" They answered, \"He deserves death.\" Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him, saying, \"Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?\" Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said, \"You also were with Jesus the Galilean.\" But he denied it before them all, saying, \"I do not know what you mean.\" And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, \"This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" And again he denied it with an oath, \"I do not know the man.\" After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, \"Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.\" Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know the man.\" And immediately the cock crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, \"Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.\" And he went out and wept bitterly. When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death; and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor."

lemcHW.PassionGospel01.text = "The Lord said to his disciples, \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and in him God is glorified; if God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews so now I say to you, 'Where I am going you cannot come.' A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\" Simon Peter said to him, \"Lord, where are you going?\" Jesus answered, \"Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward.\" Peter said to him, \"Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.\" Jesus answered, \"Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times. Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way where I am going.\" Thomas said to him, \"Lord, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?\" Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; henceforth you know him and have seen him.\" Philip said to him, \"Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied.\" Jesus said to him, \"Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; you know him, for he dwells with you, and will be in you. I will not leave you desolate; I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me; because I live, you will live also. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.\" Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, \"Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?\" Jesus answered him, \"If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me. These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. You heard me say to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe. I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go hence. I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no fruit, he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. You are already made clean by the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If a man does not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. This I command you, to love one another. If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. But all this they will do to you on my account, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. It is to fulfill the word that is written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.' But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me; and you also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the beginning. I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away. They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. And they will do this because they have not known the Father, nor me. But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you of them. I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convince the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you. A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me.\" Some of his disciples said to one another, \"What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?\" They said, \"What does he mean by 'a little while'? We do not know what he means.\" Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them, \"Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, 'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me'? Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is in travail she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child is born into the world. So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name. Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full. I have said this to you in figures; the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures but tell you plainly of the Father. In that day you will ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I shall ask the Father for you; for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from the Father. I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.\" His disciples said, \"Ah, now you are speaking plainly, not in any figure! Now we know that you know all things, and need none to question you; by this we believe that you came from God.\" Jesus answered them, \"Do you now believe? The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, every man to his home, and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, \"Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you, since you have given him power over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work which you gave me to do; and now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made. I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave me out of the world; yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you; for I have given them the words which you gave me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you did send me. I am praying for them; I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours; all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me; I have guarded them, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I am coming to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you did send me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth. I do not pray for these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word, that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory which you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to behold my glory which you have given me in your love for me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you; and these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name, and I will make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.\" When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples across the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered."

Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples. So Judas, procuring a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward and said to them, \"Whom do you seek?\" They answered him, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus said to them, \"I am he.\" Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. When he said to them, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground. Again he asked them, \"Whom do you seek?\" And they said, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus answered, \"I told you that I am he; so, if you seek me, let these men go.\" This was to fulfill the word which he had spoken, \"Of those whom you gave me I lost not one.\" Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchos. Jesus said to Peter, \"Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?\" So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him. First they led him to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he entered the court of the high priest along with Jesus, while Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and brought Peter in. The maid who kept the door said to Peter, \"Are not you also one of this man's disciples?\" He said, \"I am not.\" Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves; Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself. The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. Jesus answered him, \"I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together; I have said nothing secretly. Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me, what I said to them; they know what I said.\" When he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, \"Is that how you answer the high priest?\" Jesus answered him, \"If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\" Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, \"Are not you also one of his disciples?\" He denied it and said, \"I am not.\" One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, \"Did I not see you in the garden with him?\" Peter again denied it; and at once the cock crowed. Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was early. They themselves did not enter the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover."

But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" Then the high priest tore his robes, and said, \"He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?\" They answered, \"He deserves death.\" Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him, saying, \"Prophesy to us, you Christ: Who is it that struck you?\" Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said, \"You also were with Jesus the Galilean.\" But he denied it before them all, saying, \"I do not know what you mean.\" And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, \"This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" And again he denied it with an oath, \"I do not know the man.\" After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, \"Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.\" Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, \"I do not know the man.\" And immediately the cock crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, \"Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.\" And he went out and wept bitterly."

They themselves did not enter the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. So Pilate went out to them and said, \"What accusation do you bring against this man?\" They answered him, \"If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over.\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" The Jews said to him, \"It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.\" This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show by what death he was to die. Pilate entered the praetorium again and called Jesus, and said to him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus answered, \"Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?\" Pilate answered, \"Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?\" Jesus answered, \"My kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not of this world.\" Pilate said to him, \"So you are a king?\" Jesus answered, \"You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice.\" Pilate said to him, \"What is truth?\" After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, \"I find no crime in him. But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?\" They cried out again, \"Not this man, but Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas was a robber. Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe; they came up to him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" and struck him with their hands. Pilate went out again, and said to them, \"See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.\" So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, \"Behold the man!\" When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.\" The Jews answered him, \"We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he has made himself the Son of God.\" When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid; he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, \"Where are you from?\" But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate therefore said to him, \"You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?\" Jesus answered him, \"You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.\" Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, \"If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.\" When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, \"Behold your King!\" They cried out, \"Away with him, away with him, crucify him!\" PIlate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your King?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\" Then he handed him over to be crucified."

See to it yourself.\" And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.\" So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.\" Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\" Jesus said, \"You have said so.\" But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him, \"Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?\" But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly. Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, \"Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?\" For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, \"Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.\" Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, \"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?\" And they said, \"Barabbas.\" Pilate said to them, \"Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?\" They all said, \"Let him be crucified.\" And he said, \"Why, what evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Let him be crucified.\" So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.\" And all the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\" Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. As they went out, they came upon a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross."

Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.

But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another, \"Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.\" This was to fulfil the scripture, \"They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.\" So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son!\" Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother!\" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), \"I thirst.\" A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished\"; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth—that you also may believe. For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \"Not a bone of him shall be broken.\" 37 And again another scripture says, \"They shall look on him whom they have pierced.\""
