lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the soldiers took Jesus and led him out to be crucified. And they brought him to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull). And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. And when the sixth hour had come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\" which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" And some of the bystanders hearing it said, \"Behold, he is calling Elijah.\" And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, \"Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.\" And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, \"Truly this man was the Son of God!\" There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem."
