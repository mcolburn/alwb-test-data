lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him. And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him, \"Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?\" And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the householder, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?' And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.\" And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover. And when it was evening he came with the twelve. And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, \"Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.\" They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after another, \"Is it I?\" He said to them, \"It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.\" And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, \"Take; this is my body.\" And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, \"This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\" And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. And Jesus said to them, \"You will all fall away; for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.\" Peter said to him, \"Even though they all fall away, I will not.\" And Jesus said to him, \"Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.\" But he said vehemently, \"If I must die with you, I will not deny you.\" And they all said the same. And they went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here, while I pray.\" And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. And he said to them, \"My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.\" And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, \"Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.\" And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, \"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him. And he came the third time, and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.\""
