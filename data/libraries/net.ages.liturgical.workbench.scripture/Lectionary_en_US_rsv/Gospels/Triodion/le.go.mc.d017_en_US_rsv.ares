lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus came out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. And when he came to the place he said to them, \"Pray that you may not enter into temptation.\" And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed, \"Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.\" And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, and he said to them, \"Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.\" While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him, \"Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?\" And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, \"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?\" And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said, \"No more of this!\" And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.\" Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance; and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, \"This man also was with him.\" But he denied it, saying \"Woman, I do not know him.\" And a little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.\" But Peter said, \"Man, I am not.\" And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, \"Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.\" But Peter said, \"Man, I do not know what you are saying.\" And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.\" And he went out and wept bitterly. Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\" And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him. When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council, and they said, \"If you are the Christ, tell us.\" But he said to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I ask you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\" And they all said, \"Are you the Son of God, then?\" And he said to them, \"You say that I am.\" And they said, \"What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.\" Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate."
