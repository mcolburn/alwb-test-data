lemcLI.Gospel.text = "About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught. The Jews marveled at it saying, \"How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?\" So Jesus answered them, \"My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me; if any man's will is to do his will, he shall know whether the teacher is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority. He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is not falsehood. Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?\" The people answered, \"You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?\" Jesus answered them, \"I did one deed, and you all marvel at it. Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath. If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man's whole body well? Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.\" Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, \"Is not this the man whom they seek to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ? Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.\" So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, \"You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know. I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.\" So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come."
