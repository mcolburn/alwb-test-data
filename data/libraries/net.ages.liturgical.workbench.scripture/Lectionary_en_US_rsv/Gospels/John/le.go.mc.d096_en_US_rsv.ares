lemcLI.Gospel.text = "Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, \"I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" The Pharisees then said to him, \"You are bearing witness to yourself; your testimony is not true.\" Jesus answered, \"Even if I do bear witness to myself, my testimony is true, for I know whence I have come and whither I am going, but you do not know whence I come or whither I am going. You judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone that judge, but I and he who sent me. In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.\" They said to him therefore, \"Where is your Father?\" Jesus answered, \"You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."
