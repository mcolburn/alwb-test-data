lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who came to him, \"For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this charge I have received from my Father.\" There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. Many of them said, \"He has a demon, and he is mad; why listen to him?\" Others said, \"These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\" It was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem; it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\" Jesus answered them, \"I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life.\""
