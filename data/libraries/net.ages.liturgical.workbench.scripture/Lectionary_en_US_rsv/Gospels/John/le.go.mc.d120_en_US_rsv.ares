Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.\" And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, \"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.\""

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, \"If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, 'Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.' \" Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. When they heard these words, some of the people said, \"This is really the prophet.\" Others said, \"This is the Christ.\" But some said, \"Is the Christ to come from Galilee? Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?\" So there was a division among the people over him. Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him. The officers then went back to the chief priest and Pharisees, who said to them, \"Why did you not bring him?\" The officers answered, \"No man ever spoke like this man!\" The Pharisees answered them, \"Are you led astray, you also? Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him? But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed.\" Nikodemos, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them, \"Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?\" They replied, \"Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee.\" Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, \"I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\""
