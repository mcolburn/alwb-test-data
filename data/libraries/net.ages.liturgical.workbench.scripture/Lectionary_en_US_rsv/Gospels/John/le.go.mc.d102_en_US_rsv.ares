lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, \"How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?\" This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do. Philip answered him, \"Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little.\" One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, \"There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are they among so many?\" Jesus said, \"Make the people sit down.\" Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand. Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted. And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, \"Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.\" So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten. When the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, \"This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world!\""
