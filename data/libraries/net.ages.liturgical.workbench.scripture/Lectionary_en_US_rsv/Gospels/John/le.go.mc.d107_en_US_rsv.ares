lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, \"What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.\" But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, \"You know nothing at all; you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish.\" He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death. Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with the disciples."
