lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, John was standing with two of his disciples; and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, \"Behold, the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, \"What do you seek?\" And they said to him, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" He said to them, \"Come and see.\" They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means Christ). He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas\" (which means Peter). The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, \"Follow me.\" Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, \"We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" Nathanael said to him, \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Philip said to him, \"Come and see.\" Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, \"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\" Nathanael said to him, \"How do you know me?\" Jesus answered him, \"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.\" Nathanael answered him, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!\" Jesus answered him, \"Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.\" And he said to him, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\""
