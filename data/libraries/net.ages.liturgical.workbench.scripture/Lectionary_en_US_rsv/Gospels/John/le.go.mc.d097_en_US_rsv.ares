lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who came to him, \"I go away, and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come.\" Then said the Jews, \"Will he kill himself, since he says, 'Where I am going, you can not come'?\" He said to them, \"You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world. I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he.\" They said to him, \"Who are you?\" Jesus said to them, \"Even what I have told you from the beginning. I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.\" They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father. So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me. And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.\" As he spoke thus, many believed in him."
