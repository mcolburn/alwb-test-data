lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who came to him, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, if any one keeps my word, he will never see death.\" The Jews said to him, \"Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, 'If any one keeps my word, he will never taste death.' Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you claim to be?\" Jesus answered, \"If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God. But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; and he saw it and was glad.\" The Jews then said to him, \"You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?\" Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.\" So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple."
