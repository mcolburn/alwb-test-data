The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers at their business. And making a whip of cords, he drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, \"Take these things away; you shall not make my Father's house a house of trade.\" His disciples remembered that it was written, \"Zeal for your house will consume me.\" The Jews then said to him, \"What sign have you to show us for doing this?\" Jesus answered them, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" The Jews then said, \"It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?\" But he spoke of the temple of his body. When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken."
