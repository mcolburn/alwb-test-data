How is it that you say, 'You will be made free'?\" Jesus answered them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, every one who commits sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever. So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.\" They answered him, \"Abraham is our father.\" Jesus said to them, \"If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did, but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did. You do what your father did.\" They said to him, \"We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.\" Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.\""
