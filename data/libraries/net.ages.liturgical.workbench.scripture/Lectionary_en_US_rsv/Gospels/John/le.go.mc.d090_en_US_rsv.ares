lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who believed in him: \"I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.\" The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" So Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\""
