lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees took counsel against Jesus and said to one another, \"You see that you can do nothing; look, the world has gone after him.\" Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, \"Sir, we wish to see Jesus.\" Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus. And Jesus answered them, \"The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If any one serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me, the Father will honor him. Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour?' No, for this purpose I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.\" Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.\" The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Jesus answered, \"This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out; and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\" He said this to show by what death he was to die. The crowd answered him, \"We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\" Jesus said to them, \"The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.\""
