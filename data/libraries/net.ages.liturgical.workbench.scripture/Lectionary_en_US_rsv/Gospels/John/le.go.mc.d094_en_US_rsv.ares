lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand. So his brothers said to him, \"Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing. For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.\" For even his brothers did not believe in him. Jesus said to them, \"My time has not yet come, but your time is always here. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil. Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.\" So saying, he remained in Galilee. But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private. The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, \"Where is he?\" And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, \"He is a good man,\" others said, \"No, he is leading the people astray.\" Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him."
