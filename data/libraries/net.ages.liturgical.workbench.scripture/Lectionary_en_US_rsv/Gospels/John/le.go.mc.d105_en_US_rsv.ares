My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one.\" The Jews took up stones again to stone him. Jesus answered them, \"I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these do you stone me?\" The Jews answered him, \"It is not for a good work that we stone you but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.\" Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?' If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture cannot be broken), do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe my works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\""
