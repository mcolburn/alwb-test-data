lemeMA.Gospel.text = "In those days, Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah, and she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.\" And Mary said, \"My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior, for He has regarded the humility of His handmaiden. For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.\" And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home."

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "In those days, Elizabeth the wife of Zacharias conceived and for five months she hid herself, saying, \"Thus the Lord had done to me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.\" In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, \"Hail, O favored one, the Lord is with you!\" But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.\" And Mary said to the angel, \"How shall this be, since I have no husband?\" And the angel said to her, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible.\" And Mary said, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.\" And the angel departed from her."
