I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\""

As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\" He said therefore to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits that befit repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\" And the multitudes asked him, \"What then shall we do?\" And he answered them, \"He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.\" Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, \"Teacher, what shall we do?\" And he said to them, \"Collect no more than is appointed you.\" Soldiers also asked him, \"And we, what shall we do?\" And he said to them, \"Rob no one by violence or by false accusation, and be content with your wages.\" As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ, John answered them all, \"I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\" So, with many other exhortations, he preached good news to the people."
