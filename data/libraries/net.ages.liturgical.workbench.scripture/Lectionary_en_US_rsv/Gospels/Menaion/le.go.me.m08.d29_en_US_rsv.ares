lemeMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus; and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because John said to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place apart. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns."

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, King Herod heard that Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"It is Elijah.\" And others said, \"It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her. For John said to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.\" And she went out, and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the baptizer.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb. The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught."
