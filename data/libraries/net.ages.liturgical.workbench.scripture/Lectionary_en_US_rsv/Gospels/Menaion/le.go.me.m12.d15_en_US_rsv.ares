And the Pharisees said to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?\" And he said to them, \"Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?\" And he said to them, \"The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath.\" Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand. And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him. And he said to the man who had the withered hand, \"Come here.\" And he said to them, \"Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?\" But they were silent. And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \"Stretch it out,\" and his hand was restored."
