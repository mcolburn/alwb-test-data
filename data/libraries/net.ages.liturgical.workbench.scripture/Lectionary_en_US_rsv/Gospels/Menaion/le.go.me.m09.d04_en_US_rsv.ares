Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own household.\" And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities."
