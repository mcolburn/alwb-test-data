And as he was praying, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became dazzling white. And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they wakened they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, \"Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah\"â€”not knowing what he said. As he said this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, \"This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!\" And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silence and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen."

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led him up a high mountain apart. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is well that we are here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" He was still speaking, when lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.\" When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, \"Rise, and have no fear.\" And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, \"Tell no one the vision, until the Son of man is raised from the dead.\""
