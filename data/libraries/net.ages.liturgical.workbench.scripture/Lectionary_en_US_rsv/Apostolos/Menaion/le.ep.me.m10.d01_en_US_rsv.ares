lemeLI.Epistle2.text = "In those days, there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, \"Ananias.\" And he said, \"Here I am, Lord.\" And the Lord said to him, \"Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying, and he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.\" But Ananias answered, \"Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.\" But the Lord said to him, \"Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.\" So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\" And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized, and took food and was strengthened."
