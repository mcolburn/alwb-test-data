lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, at Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort, a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms liberally to the people, and prayed constantly to God. About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, \"Cornelius.\" And he stared at him in terror, and said, \"What is it, Lord?\" And he said to him, \"Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and bring one Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.\" When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those that waited on him, and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. The next day, as they were on their journey and coming near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. And he became hungry and desired something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance and saw the heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth. In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. And there came a voice to him, \"Rise, Peter; kill and eat.\" But Peter said, \"No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.\" And the voice came to him again a second time, \"What God has cleansed, you must not call common.\" This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven."
