lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, the apostles departed and came to Caesarea; and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. And he had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. While we were staying for some days, a prophet named Agabos came down from Judea. And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands, and said, \"Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.' \" When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul answered, \"What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\" And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, \"The will of the Lord be done.\""
