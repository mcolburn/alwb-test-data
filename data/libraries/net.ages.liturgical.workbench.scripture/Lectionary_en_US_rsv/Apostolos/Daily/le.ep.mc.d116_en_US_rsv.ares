lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Paul, looking intently at the council, said, \"Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience up to this day.\" And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. Then Paul said to him, \"God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?\" Those who stood by said, \"Would you revile God's high priest?\" And Paul said, \"I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.' \" But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, \"Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial.\" And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided. For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. Then a great clamor arose; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended, \"We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?\" And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks. The following night the Lord stood by him and said, \"Take courage, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome.\""
