lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, as we apostles were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by soothsaying. She followed Paul and us, crying, \"These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.\" And this she did for many days. But Paul was annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, \"I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.\" And it came out that very hour. But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the rulers; and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, \"These men are Jews and they are disturbing our city. They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.\" The crowd joined in attacking them; and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. Having received this charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were unfastened. When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul cried with a loud voice, \"Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.\" And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out and said, \"Men, what must I do to be saved?\" And they said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\" And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, with all his family. Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God."
