lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual up building . Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for any one to make others fall I by what he eats; it is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble or be upset or be weakened. The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God; happy is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves. But he who has doubts is condemned, if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret for long ages but is now disclosed and through the prophetic writings is made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith - to the only wise God be glory for evermore through Jesus Christ! Amen."
