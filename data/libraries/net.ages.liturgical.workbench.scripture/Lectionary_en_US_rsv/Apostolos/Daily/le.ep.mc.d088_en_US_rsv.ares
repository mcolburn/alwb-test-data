lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, \"Give me also this power, that any one on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\" But Peter said to him, \"Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.\" And Simon answered, \"Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.\" Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans."
