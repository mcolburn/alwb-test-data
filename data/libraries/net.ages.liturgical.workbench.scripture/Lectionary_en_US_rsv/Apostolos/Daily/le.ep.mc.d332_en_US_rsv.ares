lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, see that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less shall we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. His voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, \"Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.\" This phrase, \"Yet once more,\" indicates the removal of what is shaken, as of what has been made, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain. Therefore I appeal to you, brethren, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. You should understand that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon. Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings. Grace be with all of you. Amen."
