lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf? Why am I in peril every hour? I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day! What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesos? If the dead are not raised, \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\" Do not be deceived: \"Bad company ruins good morals.\" Come to your right mind, and sin no more. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. But some one will ask, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?\" You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or some other grain. But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body."
