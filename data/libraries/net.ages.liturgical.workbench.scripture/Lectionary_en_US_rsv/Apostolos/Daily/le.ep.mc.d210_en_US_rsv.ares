But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glorification. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written, \"What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.\""
