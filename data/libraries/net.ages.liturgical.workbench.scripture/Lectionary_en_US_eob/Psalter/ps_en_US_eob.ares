He that dwells in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall mock them. Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble them in his fury. But I have been made king by him on Zion his holy mountain, declaring the ordinance of the Lord: the Lord said to me: You are my Son, today have I begotten you. Ask of me and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession. You shall rule them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces as a potter’s vessel. Now, therefore understand, you kings: be instructed, all you that judge the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice in him with trembling. Accept correction, for fear that at any time the Lord be angry, and that you should perish from the righteous way: when his wrath shall be suddenly kindled, blessed are all those who trust in him!"

When my enemies are turned back, they shall be feeble and perish at your presence. For you have maintained my cause and my right; you sat on the throne, that judge righteousness. You have rebuked the nations and the ungodly one has perished; you have blotted out their name for ever, even unto ages of ages. The swords of the enemy have failed utterly; and you have destroyed cities: their memorial has been destroyed with a noise, but the Lord endures for ever: he has prepared his throne for judgment. He will judge the world in righteousness, he will judge the nations in uprightness. The Lord also has become a refuge for the poor, a timely help in affliction. Let those who know your name hope in you: for you, O Lord, have not failed those who diligently seek you. Sing praises to the Lord who dwells in Zion: declare his dealings among the nations. For he remembered them, in avenging for blood: he has not forgotten the supplication of the poor. Have mercy upon me, O Lord; look upon the affliction I suffer of my enemies, you that lift me up from the gates of death: that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will exult in your salvation. The heathen are caught in the destruction which they planned: in the very snare which they hid is their foot taken. The Lord is known as executing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his hands. Let sinners be driven away into hades, even all the nations that forget God. For the poor shall not be forgotten for ever: the patience of the needy ones shall not perish for ever. Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged before you. Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them: let the heathen know that they are mere humans. Why stand you afar off, O Lord? why do you overlook us in times of need, in affliction? While the ungodly one acts proudly, the poor is hotly pursued: the wicked are taken in the crafty counsels which they imagine. Because the sinner praises himself for the desires of his heart; and the unjust one blesses himself. The sinner has provoked the Lord: according to the abundance of his pride he will not seek after him: God is not before him. His ways are profane at all times; your judgments are removed from before him: he will gain the mastery over all his enemies. For the sinner has said in his heart, “I shall not be moved from generation to generation without evil.” His mouth is full of cursing, bitterness and fraud: under his tongue are trouble and pain. He lies in wait with rich men in secret places, in order to kill the innocent: his eyes are set against the poor. He lies in wait in secret as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to ravish the poor, to ravish the poor when he draws him after him: he will bring him down in his snare. He will bow down and fall when he has mastered the poor. For he has said in his heart, God has forgotten: God has turned away his face so as never to look. Arise, O Lord God; let your hand be lifted up: Do not forget the poor. Why then, has the wicked provoked God? for he has said in his heart, God will not punish. You see it; for you do observe trouble and wrath, to deliver them into your hands: the poor has been left to you; you were a helper to the orphan.

The Lord is my firm support and my refuge and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; he is my defender and the horn of my salvation and my helper. I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from my enemies. The pangs of death pressed on me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly. The pangs of hades came around me: the snares of death encircled me. When I was afflicted I called upon the Lord and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple; my cry shall enter before him, even into his ears. Then the earth shook and quaked, the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, they were shaken, because God was angry with them. There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it. He bowed the heaven and came down: thick darkness was under his feet. He mounted on cherubim and flew: he flew on the wings of winds. He made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, even dark water in the clouds of the air. At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire. The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice. He sent forth his weapons and scattered them; he multiplied lightnings and they were confused. The springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of your wrath. He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters. He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from those who hate me; for they are stronger than I. They prevented me in the day of my affliction: but the Lord was my stay against them. He brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me. The Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me. For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me. I shall be blameless with them, and shall keep myself from my iniquity. The Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes. With the holy you will be holy; and with the innocent you will be innocent. With the excellent man you will be excellent; and with the perverse you will show your strength. For you will save the lowly people, and will humble the eyes of the proud. For you, O Lord, will light my lamp: my God, you will lighten my darkness. For by you shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall. As for my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all those who hope in him. For who is God but the Lord? And who is a god except our God? It is God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless: who strengthens my feet as the feet of a deer, and sets me upon high places. He instructs my hands for war: and you have made my arms as a brazen bow. You have made me secure in my salvation: your right hand has helped me and your correction has upheld me to the end; yes, your correction itself shall instruct me. You have made room for my goings under me, and by footsteps did not fail. I will pursue my enemies and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed. I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet. For you have girded me with strength for war: you have beaten down under me all that rose up against me. you have also shown me the back of my enemies [as they fled]; and you have destroyed those who hated me. They cried, but there was no deliverer: even to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them. I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind. Deliver me from the opposition of the people: you shall make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me, at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: foreign children cringed before me. The foreign children became old, they became lame and fell away from their paths. The Lord lives; and blessed be my God; Let the God of my salvation be exalted. It is God that avenges me, he has subdued the nations under me! [You are] my deliverer from angry enemies: you shall set me on high above those who rise up against me: you shall deliver me from the unrighteous man. Therefore I will confess to you, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to your name. God magnifies the deliverances of his king; he deals mercifully with David his anointed, and with his descendants for ever."

O my God, I will cry to you by day, but you will not hear: and [when I will cry to you] by night, it shall not be considered as folly to me. But you, the praise of Israel, dwell in a sanctuary. Our fathers hoped in you; they hoped and you did deliver them. They cried to you and were saved: they hoped in you and were not ashamed. But I am a worm and not a man; a reproach of men and scorn of the people. All who saw me mocked me: they spoke with their lips, they shook the head, saying: He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him, let the Lord save him if he takes pleasure in this man. For you are the one that drew me out of the womb; my hope from my mother’s breasts. I have depended on you from the womb: you are my God from my mother’s womb. Do not stand far away from me; for affliction is near and there is no helper. Many bullocks have surrounded me: fat bulls have beset me all around. They have opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and roaring lion. I am poured out like water and all my bones are loosened: my heart has become like melting wax. My strength is dried up like an empty jar; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and you have brought me down to the dust of death. For many dogs have surrounded me: the assembly of the wicked doers has encircled me: they have pierced my hands and my feet. They counted all my bones; and they observed and gazed at me. They parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots for my clothing. But you, O Lord, do not be distant to help: be ready to come to my assistance. Deliver my soul from the sword; my uniquely loved from the power of the dog. Save me from the lion’s mouth; in my humiliation, [save me] from the one-horned beast. I will declare your name to my brothers: in the midst of the assembly will I sing praise to you. you that fear the Lord, praise him; all you descendants of Jacob, glorify him: let all the descendants of Israel fear him. For he has not despised nor been angry at the supplication of the poor; nor turned away his face from me; but when I cried to him, he heard me. I praise you in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before those who fear him. The poor shall eat and be satisfied; and those who seek him shall praise the Lord: their heart shall live for ever. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him. For the kingdom is the Lord’s; He is the governor of the nations. All the prosperous of the earth have eaten and worshiped: all that go down to the earth shall fall down before him: my soul also lives to him, and my descendants shall serve him: the generation that is coming shall be known to the Lord. They shall declare his righteousness to the people that shall be born, whom the Lord has made."

How abundant is the multitude of your goodness, O Lord, which you have laid up for those who fear you! You have accomplished it out for those who hope on you, in the presence of the sons of men. You will hide them in the secret of your presence from the scrutiny of man: you will screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of [slandering] tongues.

For without cause they have hidden for me their destructive snare: without a cause they have insulted my soul. Let a snare which they know not come upon them; and the net which they hid take them; Let them fall into that very snare. But my soul shall exult in the Lord: it shall delight in his salvation. All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like to you? delivering the poor out of the hand of those who are stronger, yes, the poor and needy from those who spoil him. Unjust witnesses arose and asked me of things I knew not. They rewarded me evil for good and barrenness to my soul. But I when they troubled me, put on sackcloth, and I humbled my soul with fasting: my prayer shall return to my own bosom. I behaved agreeably towards them as with a neighbor or brother: I humbled myself as one mourning and sad of countenance. Yet they rejoiced against me, and plagues were plentifully brought against me; I knew it not: they were scattered, but did not repented. They tempted me, they sneered at me with contempt, they gnashed their teeth upon me. O Lord when will you look upon me? Deliver my soul from their mischief, my uniquely precious [life] from the lions. I will give thanks to you even in a great congregation: among many people I will praise you. Let not those who are my enemies without a cause rejoice against me; they hate me for nothing and conspire with their eyes. For to me they spoke peaceably, but imagined deceits in their anger. They opened wide their mouth upon me; they said Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it. You have seen it, O Lord: do not keep silence: O Lord, do not withdraw yourself from me. Awake, O Lord and attend to my judgment, even to my cause, my God and my Lord. Judge me, O Lord, according to your righteousness, O Lord my God; Let them not rejoice against me. Let them not say in their hearts, Aha, aha, it is pleasing to our soul: neither let them say, We have devoured him! Let them be confounded and ashamed together those who rejoice at my afflictions: let them be clothed with shame and confusion as they speak great words against me. Let those who rejoice in my righteousness exult and be glad: Let those who desire the peace of his servant always say, The Lord be magnified! My tongue shall meditate on your righteousness, and on your praise all the day."

psa36.text = "Do not fret because of the wicked, neither be envious of those who do iniquity. For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs. Hope in the Lord and do good; dwell on the land and you shall be fed with its riches. Delight yourself in the Lord; He shall grant you the requests of your heart. Disclose your way to the Lord and hope in him; He shall bring it to pass. He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noon-day. Submit yourself to the Lord and supplicate him: Do not fret because of the one that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds. Ease from anger and forsake wrath: fret not yourself so as to do evil. For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but those who wait on the Lord, shall inherit the land. Yet a little while and the sinner shall not be, you shall seek for his place and not find it. But the meek shall inherit the earth; they shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him. But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come. Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to kill the upright in heart. Let their sword enter into their own heart, and their bows be broken. A little is better to the righteous than the abundant wealth of sinners. For the arms of sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous. The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever. They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be satisfied. For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honored and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke. The sinner borrows and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion and gives. For those who bless him shall inherit the earth; and those who curse him shall be utterly destroyed. The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: He will take pleasure in his way. When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand. I was once young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his descendants seeking bread. He is merciful and lends continually; and his offspring shall be blessed. Turn aside from evil and do good; That you may dwell for ever. For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless shall be avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed. But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever. The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, his tongue will speak of judgment. The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall not slide. The sinner watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him. But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him when he is judged. Wait on the Lord and keep his way, He shall exalt you to inherit the land: when the wicked are destroyed, you shall see it. I saw the ungodly exalting himself very highly, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Lebanon. Yet I passed by and Behold! he was not [there]: I sought him, but his place was not found. Maintain innocence and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the peaceable man. But the transgressors shall be utterly destroyed: the remnants of the ungodly shall be devastated. But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; He is their defender in the time of affliction. The Lord shall help them and deliver them: He shall rescue them from sinners and save them, because they have hoped in him."

I was speechless and humbled myself, I kept silence from good words; and my grief was renewed. My heart grew hot within me, and a fire would kindle in my meditation: I spoke with my tongue, O Lord, make me to know my end, and the number of my days, what it is; that I may know what I lack. Behold, you have made my days old; and my existence is as nothing before you: No, every man living is altogether vanity. Surely man walks in a shadow; No, he is disquieted in vain: he lays up treasures and knows not for whom he shall gather them. And now what is my expectation? is it not the Lord? And my ground of hope is with you. Deliver me from all my transgressions: you have made me a reproach to the foolish. I was speechless and opened not my mouth; for you are he that made me.

The daughter of Tyre shall present him gifts; the rich of the people of the land shall supplicate your favor.

They shall be brought with gladness and exultation: they shall be led into the king’s temple. Instead of your fathers, children are born to you: you shall make them princes over all the earth. They shall make mention of your name from generation to generation: therefore shall the nations give thanks to you for ever, even unto ages of ages."

You shall sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be purified: you shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You shall cause me to hear gladness and joy: the afflicted bones shall rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inner being. Do not cast me away from your presence; and do not remove your holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation: establish me with your guiding Spirit. Then will I teach transgressors your ways; and ungodly men shall return to you.

As smoke vanishes, let them vanish: as wax melts before the fire, so let the sinners perish from before God. But let the righteous rejoice; let them exult before God: let them be delighted with joy. Sing to God, sing praises to his name: make a way for him that ascended into the west (the Lord is his name) and exult before him. They shall be troubled before his face; he is the father of the orphans and judge of the widows: such is God in his holy place. God settles the solitary in a house; leading forth prisoners mightily, also those who act provokingly, even those who dwell in tombs. O God when you went forth before your people when you went through the wilderness; the earth quaked, yes, the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sinai, at the presence of the God of Israel. O God, you will grant to your inheritance a gracious rain; for it was weary, but you did refresh it. Your creatures dwell in it: you have in your goodness prepared for the poor. The Lord God will give a word to those who preach the good news in much power. The king of the powers of the beloved, even in the beauty of the house divides the spoils. Even if you should lie among the lots, you shall have the wings of a dove covered with silver and her chest with yellow gold. When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall be made snow-white in Selmon. The mountain of God is a rich mountain; a swelling mountain, a rich mountain. Why then do you conceive evil, you swelling mountains? This is the mountain which God has delighted to dwell in; yes, the Lord will dwell in it for ever. The chariots of God are ten thousand fold, thousands of rejoicing ones: the Lord is among them, in Sinai, in the holy place. You have gone up on high, you have led captivity captive, you have received gifts for man, yes, for they were rebellious, that you might dwell among them. Blessed be the Lord God, blessed be the Lord every day; and the God of our salvation shall prosper us. Our God is the God of salvation; and to the Lord belong the escape from death. But God will shatter the heads of his enemies; the hairy crown of those who go on in their trespasses. The Lord said: I will bring them again from Basan, I will bring my people again through the depths of the sea. That your foot may be dipped in blood and the tongue of your dogs be stained with that of your enemies. Your goings, O God, have been seen; the goings of my God, the king, in the sanctuary. The princes went first, next before the players on instruments, in the midst of young women playing on timbrels. Praise God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountains of Israel. There is Benjamin the younger one in ecstasy, the princes of Juda their rulers, the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali. O God, command your strength: strengthen, O God, what you have accomplished in us. Because of your temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to you. Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed: let the crowd of bulls with the heifers of the nations be rebuked, so that they who have been proved with silver may not be shut out: scatter the nations that wish for wars. Ambassadors shall arrive out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hand to God. Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth; sing psalms to the Lord. Sing to God that has ascended upon the heaven of heaven, eastward: Behold, he will utter a mighty sound with his voice. Give glory to God: his excellency is over Israel and his power is in the clouds. God is wonderful in his holy places, the God of Israel: he will give power and strength to his people: blessed be God."

I am weary of crying, my throat has become hoarse; my eyes have failed by my waiting on my God. Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: the enemies that persecute me unrighteously are strengthened: then I restored that which I took not away. O God, you know my foolishness; and my transgressions are not hidden from you. Let not those who wait on you, O Lord of Hosts, be ashamed on my account: let not those who seek you, be ashamed on my account, O God of Israel. For I have suffered reproach for your sake; shame has covered my face. I became a foreigner to my brothers and a stranger to my mother’s children. For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; and the reproaches of those who reproached you are fallen upon me. I bowed down my soul with fasting and that was made my reproach. I put on sackcloth for my covering; and I became a proverb to them. Those who sit in the gate talked against me and those who drank wine sang against me. But I will cry to you, O Lord, in my prayer; O God, it is a propitious time: in the multitude of your mercy hear me, in the truth of your salvation. Save me from the mire, that I may not be lost in it: let me be delivered from those who hate me and from the deep waters. Let not the waterflood drown me, nor let the deep swallow me up; neither let the well shut its mouth upon me. Hear me, O Lord; for your mercy is good: according to the multitude of your compassions look upon me. And turn not away your face from your servant; for I am afflicted: hear me speedily. Draw near to my soul and redeem it: deliver me because of my enemies. For you know my reproach and my shame and my confusion; all that afflict me are before you. My soul has waited for reproach and misery; and I waited for one to grieve with me, but there was none; and for one to comfort me, but I found none. They gave me also gall for my food and made me drink vinegar for my thirst. Let their table before them be for a snare and for a recompense and for a stumbling-block. Let their eyes be darkened that they should not see; and bow down their back continually. Pour out your wrath upon them, Let the fury of your anger take hold on them. Let their habitation be made desolate; Let there be no inhabitant in their tents: Because they persecuted him whom you have stricken; and they have added to the grief of my wounds. Add iniquity to their iniquity; Let them not come into your righteousness. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, Let them not be written with the righteous. I am poor and sorrowful; but the salvation of your countenance has helped me. I will praise the name of my God with a song, I will magnify him with praise; and this shall please God more than a young calf having horns and hoofs. Let the poor see and rejoice; seek the Lord diligently and you shall live. For the Lord hears the poor and does not set at nought his fettered ones. Let the heavens and the earth raise him, the sea and all things moving in them. For God will save Zion and the cities of Judea shall be built; men shall dwell there and inherit it. The descendants of his servants shall possess it and those who love his name shall dwell in it."

psa77.text = "Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter obscure sayings which have been from the beginning; All which we have heard and known and our fathers have declared to us. They were not hid from their children to a second generations; the fathers declaring the praises of the Lord and his mighty acts and his wonders which he accomplished. He raised up a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded to our fathers, to make it known to their children: that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they [too] should arise and proclaim them to their children. That they might set their hope on God and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments. That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which did not set its heart aright and whose spirit was not steadfast with God. The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting with the bow, turned back in the day of battle. They did not keep the covenant of God and would not walk in his law. They forgot his blessings and the miracles which he had showed them; the miracles which he accomplished before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. He opened the sea and led them through: he made the waters to stand as in a jar. He guided them with a cloud by day and all the night with a light of fire. He split a rock in the wilderness and made them drink as in a great deep. He brought water out of the rock and caused waters to flow down as rivers. They sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. They tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for the desire of their souls. They spoke also against God and said: Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? Since he smote the rock and the waters flowed the torrents ran abundantly; will he also be able to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? Therefore the Lord heard and was provoked: fire was kindled in Jacob and wrath went up against Israel. Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation. Yet he commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven, he rained upon them manna to eat and gave them the bread of heaven. Man ate angels’ bread; he sent them provision to the full. He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind. He rained upon them meat like dust and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. They fell into the midst of their camp, all around their tents. So they ate and were completely filled; He gave them their desire. They were not disappointed of their desire: but as food was still in their mouth, the indignation of God rose up against them, He killed those who were so well fed and overthrew the leading men of Israel. In the midst of all this they sinned even more and did not believe in his miracles. Their days were consumed in vanity and their years with anxiety. When God killed them, they began to seek him: they returned and called early upon God. They remembered that God was their helper and that the Most High God was their redeemer. Yet they loved him only with their mouth and lied to him with their tongue. Indeed, their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. But he is compassionate and will forgive their sins, he will not destroy them: yes, he will frequently turn away his wrath and will not kindle all his anger. He remembered that they are flesh; a breath that passes away and returns not. How often they provoked him in the wilderness and anger him in a dry land! Yes, they turned back and tempted God, they provoked the Holy One of Israel. They did not remember his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. How he had accomplished his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Tanes: how he changed their rivers into blood; even their streams so that they should not drink. Against them he sent the dog-fly and it devoured them; and the frog and it spoiled them. He gave their fruit to the canker worm and their labors to the locust. He killed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost. He gave up their cattle to hail and their livelihood to the fire. He sent out against them the fury of his anger, Wrath, indignation and affliction, a message by evil angels. He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; he smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labors in the tents of Cham. He removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. He guided them with hope and they did not fear: but the sea covered their enemies. He brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. He cast out the nations from before them, he made them to inherit by a line of inheritance and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. Yet they tempted and provoked the Most High God, not keeping his commandments. They turned back and broke covenant, even as their fathers had done: they became like a crooked bow. They provoked him with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. God heard them and considered them lightly, He greatly despised Israel. He rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men. He gave their strength into captivity and their beauty into the enemy’s hand. He gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins did not mourn. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. So the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. He stroke his enemies in the back parts: he brought upon them a perpetual shame. He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; instead he chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Zion which he loved. He built his sanctuary as the place of single-horns; he founded it for ever on the earth. He also chose David his servant and took him up from the flocks of sheep. He took him from following sheep old and young, to become the shepherd of Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance. So he tended them in the innocence of his heart; and guided them by the skillfullness of his hands."

For you have said: Mercy shall be built up for ever: your truth shall be established in the heavens. I made a covenant with my chosen ones, I swore to David my servant: I will establish your seed for ever and build up your throne to all generations. The heavens shall declare your wonders, O Lord; and your truth in the assembly of the saints. For who in the heavens shall be compared to the Lord? And who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of God? God is glorified in the council of the saints; great and terrible toward all that are around him. O Lord God of Hosts, who is like to you? You are mighty, O Lord and your truth is around you. You rule the power of the sea; and you calm the tumult of its waves. You have brought down the proud as one that is slain; with the arm of your power you have scattered your enemies. The heavens are yours and the earth is yours: you have founded the world and the fullness of it. You have created the north and the west: Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your Name. Yours is the mighty arm: let your hand be strengthened, let your right hand be exalted. Justice and judgment are the establishment of your throne: mercy and truth shall go before your face. Blessed is the people who knows the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of your countenance. In your Name shall they rejoice all the day: and in your righteousness shall they be exalted. For you are the boast of their strength; and in your good pleasure shall our horn be exalted; Indeed our help is of the Lord; and of the Holy One of Israel, our king. Then you spoke in vision to your children and said, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have exalted one chosen out of my people. I have found David my servant; I have anointed him by my holy mercy. For my hand shall support him; and my arm shall strengthen him. The enemy shall have no advantage against him; and the son of transgression shall not hurt him again. I will slash down his foes before him and put to flight those who hate him. But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted. I will set his hand in the sea and his right hand in the rivers. He shall call upon me, saying: You are my Father, my God and the helper of my salvation. I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth. I will keep my mercy for him for ever and my covenant shall be firm with him. I will establish his seed unto ages of ages and his throne as the days of heaven. If his children should forsake my law and not walk in my judgments; if they should profane my ordinances and not keep my commandments; I will visit their transgressions with a rod and their sins with scourges. But I will not utterly remove my mercy from him, nor wrong my truth. Neither will I by any means profane my covenant; I will not make void the things that proceed out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David. His seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me; as the moon that is established for ever, and as the faithful witness in heaven. But you have cast off and set at nought, you have rejected your anointed. You have overthrown the covenant of your servant; you have profaned his sanctuary, casting it to the ground. You have broken down all his hedges; you have made his strongholds a terror. All that go by the way have spoiled him: he has become a reproach to his neighbors. You have exalted the right hand of his enemies; you have made all his enemies to rejoice. You have turned back the help of his sword and have not helped him in the battle. You have deprived him of glory: you have broken down his throne to the ground. You have shortened the days of his throne: you have poured shame upon him. How long, O Lord, will you turn away, for ever? Shall your anger flame out as fire? Remember what my being is: for have you created all the sons of men in vain? What man is there who shall live and not see death? Shall anyone deliver his soul from the hand of hades? Where are your ancient mercies, O Lord, which you swore to David in your truth? Remember, O Lord, the reproach of your servants, which I have borne in my bosom, even the reproach of many nations; by which your enemies have reviled, O Lord: by which they have reviled the recompense of your anointed. Blessed be the Lord for ever. Amen, Amen."

Bring to the Lord, you families of the Gentiles, bring to the Lord glory and honor! Bring to the Lord the glory that is fitting for his name: take offerings and go into his courts. Worship the Lord in his holy court: let all the earth tremble before him. Say among the heathen, The Lord reigns: for he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people in righteousness. Let the heavens rejoice and the earth exult; let the sea be moved with its fullness. The plains shall rejoice and all things in them: then shall all the trees of the forest exult before the presence of the Lord: for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness and the people with his truth."

O Lord my God, you are very great; you have clothed yourself with praise and honor: you robe yourself with light as with a garment; spreading out the heaven as a curtain. who covers his chambers with waters; who makes the clouds his chariot; who walks on the wings of the wind. Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flaming fire. Who establishes the earth on her sure foundation: it shall not be moved for ever. The deep, as it were a garment, is his covering: the waters stood above the hills. At your rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of your thunder they shall be alarmed. They go up to the mountains and down to the plains, to the place which you have founded for them. You have set a bound which they shall not pass, neither shall they return to cover the earth. He sends forth his fountains among the valleys: the waters shall run between the mountains. They shall give drink to all the wild beasts of the field: the wild donkeys shall take of them to quench their thirst. By them shall the birds of the sky dwell: they shall utter a voice out of the midst of the rocks. He waters the mountains from his chambers: the earth shall be satisfied with the fruit of your works. He makes grass to grow for the cattle and plants for the service of men, to bring bread out of the earth; and wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil: bread strengthens man’s heart. The trees of the plain shall be full of sap; even the cedars of Lebanon which he planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the stork takes the lead among them. The high mountains are a refuge for the stags and the rock for the rabbits. He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knows his going down. You made darkness and it was night; in it all the wild beasts of the forest creep forth: even young lions roaring for [their] prey and to seek meat for themselves from God. The sun arises and they shall be gathered together, they shall lie down in their dens. Man shall go forth to his work and to his labor until the evening. How great are your works, O Lord! in wisdom have you have made them all: the earth is filled with your creation. So is this great and wide sea: there are things creeping innumerable, animals both small and great. There go the ships; and this dragon you have made to play in it. All wait upon you, to give them their food in due season. When you have given it them, they will gather it; when you have opened your hand, they shall all be filled with good. But when you have turned away your face, they shall be troubled: you will take away their breath; they shall fail and return to their dust. You shall send forth your Spirit and they shall be created; and you shall renew the face of the earth. Let the glory of the Lord be for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works; who looks upon the earth and makes it tremble; who touches the mountains and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being. Let my meditation be sweet to him: I will rejoice in the Lord! Let the sinners vanish from the earth, and transgressors, that they shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul!"

Remember his wonderful works that he has done; his wonders and the judgments of his mouth; you seed of Abra’am, his servants, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth. He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded for a thousand generation: which he established as a covenant to Abra’am, He remembered his oath to Isaac. He established it to Jacob as an ordinance and to Israel for an everlasting covenant; saying To you will I give the land of C’anaan, the line of your inheritance: when they were few in number, very few and sojourners in it. They went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another. He suffered no man to wrong them; He rebuked kings for their sakes: saying: Touch not my anointed ones; and do my prophets no harm. Moreover, he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole support of bread. He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave. They hurt his feet with fetters; his soul passed into iron, until the time that his cause came on; the word of the Lord tried him as fire. The king sent [word] and released him; even the prince of the people, let him go free. He made him Lord over his house and ruler of all his possessions; to chastise his rulers at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom. Israel also came into Egypt and Jacob sojourned in the land of Cham. He increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. He sent forth Moses his servant and Aaron whom he had chosen. He established among them his signs and his wonders in the land of Cham. He sent forth darkness and made it dark; yet they rebelled against his words. He turned their waters into blood and killed their fish. Their land produced frogs abundantly, in the chambers of their kings. He spoke and the dog-fly came and lice in all their coasts. He turned their rain into hail and sent flaming fire in their land. He afflicted their vines and their fig trees; and broke every tree of their coast. He spoke and the locust came with innumerable caterpillars, they devoured all the grass in their land and devoured the fruit of the ground. He also smote every first-born of their land, the first-fruits of all their labor. He brought them out with silver and gold; and there was not a feeble one among their tribes. Egypt rejoiced at their departing; for the fear of them fell upon them. He spread out a cloud for a covering to them and fire to give them light by night. They asked and the quail came, He satisfied them with the bread of heaven. He split the rock and the waters flowed, rivers ran in dry places. For he remembered his holy word, which he promised to Abra’am his servant. He brought out his people with exultation and his chosen with joy; He gave them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labors of the people; so that they might keep his ordinances and diligently seek his law."

Blessed are those who keep judgment and do righteousness at all times. Remember us, O Lord, with the favor you have to your people: visit us with your salvation; that we may behold the good of your elect, that we may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that we may glory with your inheritance. We have sinned with our fathers, we have transgressed, we have acted unrighteously. Our fathers in Egypt understood not your wonders and remembered not the multitude of your mercy; but they provoked him as they went up by the Red Sea. Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might cause his mighty power to be known. He rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness. He saved them out of the hand of those who hated them and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy. The water covered those who oppressed them: there was not one of them left. Then they believed his words and celebrated his praise. They made haste, they forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the dry land. He gave them their request and sent fullness into their souls. They also provoked Moses in the camp and Aaron the holy one of the Lord. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and closed upon the congregation of Abiron. Then a fire was kindled in their assembly and a flame burnt up the sinners. They made a calf in Choreb and worshiped the graven image, they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that feeds on grass. They forgot God that saved them, [God] who had accomplished great deeds in Egypt; wondrous works in the land of Cham and awesome things at the Red Sea. So God said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn him away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them. Moreover, they disregarded the desirable land and believed not his word. They murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the wilderness; and to cast down their seed among the nations, to scatter them in the countries. They were joined also to Beelphegor and ate the sacrifices of the dead. They provoked him with their devices; and destruction, was multiplied among them. Then Phinees stood up and made atonement: and the plague came to an end. This was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever. They also provoked him at the water of Strife and Moses was hurt for their sakes; for they provoked his spirit, He spoke unwisely with his lips. They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them to destroy; but were mingled with the heathen and learned their works. They served their graven images; and it became an offence to them. They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils, and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of C’anaan; and the land was defiled with blood, it was polluted with their works; and they became immoral with their own devices. So the Lord was very angry with his people, He abhorred his inheritance, He delivered them into the hands of their enemies; and those who hated them ruled over them. Their enemies oppressed them and they were brought down under their hands. Many times God delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, they were brought low by their [own] iniquities. The Lord looked upon their affliction when he heard their petition. He remembered his covenant and his mind was renewed according to the multitude of his mercy. He caused them to be pitied in the sight of all who carried them captive. Save us, O Lord our God and gather us from among the heathen, So that we may give thanks to your holy name, So that we may glory in your praise. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to ages of ages; and all the people shall say, Amen, Amen!"

Let them say so who have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy; and gathered them out of the countries, from the east and west and north and south. They wandered in the wilderness in a dry land; they found no way to a city of habitation. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, He delivered them out of their distresses. He guided them into a straight path, So that they might go to a city of habitation. Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies and his wonderful works to the children of men. For he satisfies the empty soul and fills the hungry soul with good things, even those who sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, fettered in poverty and iron; because they rebelled against the words of God and provoked the counsel of the Most High. So their heart was brought low with troubles; they were weak and there was no helper. Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, He saved them out of their distresses. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, He broke their bonds asunder. Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies and his wonders to the children of men. For he broke to pieces the brazen gates and crushed the iron bars. He helped them out of the way of their iniquity; for they were brought low because of their iniquities. Their soul began to desert all food; and they drew near to the gates of death. Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction, He saved them out of their distresses. He sent his word and healed them, he delivered them out of their destructions. Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies and his wonderful works to the children of men. Let them offer to him the sacrifice of praise and proclaim this works with exultation. Those who go down to the sea in ships, doing business in many waters; these men have seen the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep. He speaks and the stormy wind arises and its waves are lifted up. They rise to the heavens and go down to the depths; their soul melts out of anguish. They are troubled, they stagger as a drunkard and all their wisdom is swallowed up. Then they cry to the Lord in their affliction, He brings them out of their distresses. He commands the storm and it is calmed into a gentle breeze and its waves are still. They are glad, because they are quiet; He guides them to their desired haven. Let them acknowledge to the Lord his mercies and his wonderful works to the children of men. Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people and praise him in the seat of the elders. He turns rivers into a desert and streams of water into a dry land; a fruitful land into saltness, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it. He turns a wilderness into pools of water and a dry land into streams of water. There he causes the hungry to dwell and they establish for themselves dwelling places. They sow fields and plant vineyards, and they yield fruit in abundance. He blesses them and they multiply exceedingly, He diminishes not the number of their cattle. Again they become few and are brought low, by the pressure of evils and pain. Contempt is poured upon their princes, He causes them to wander in a desert and trackless land. But he helps the poor out of poverty and makes him families as a flock. The upright shall see and rejoice; and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. Who is wise and will observe these things, and understand the mercies of the Lord?"

They have surrounded me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but I continued to pray. They rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love. Set a sinner against him; Let the devil stand at his right hand. When he is judged, let him go forth condemned: Let his prayer become sin. Let his days be few: Let another take his office of overseer. Let his children be orphans and his wife a widow. Let his children wander without a dwelling-place and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations. Let his creditor exact all that belongs to him: Let strangers spoil his labors. Let him have no helper; may there be no one to have compassion on his fatherless children. Let his children be given up to utter destruction: in one generation let his name be blotted out. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; Let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. Let them be before the Lord continually; Let their memorial be blotted out from the earth. Because he remembered not to show mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man and desired to kill him in the heart. He also loved cursing and it shall come upon him; He took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him. Yes, he put on cursing as a garment and it has come as water into his bowels and as oil into his bones. Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually. This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me and of those who speak evil against my soul. But you, O Lord, Lord, deal mercifully with me, for your name’s sake: for your mercy is good. Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me. I am removed as a shadow in its descent: I am tossed up and down like locusts. My knees are weakened through fasting and my flesh is changed because of the want of oil. I became also a reproach to them: when they saw me they shook their heads. Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to your mercy. Let them know that this is your hand; and that you, Lord, have accomplished it. Let them curse, but you shall bless: let those who rise up against me be ashamed, but let your servant rejoice. Let those who falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, Let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle. I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him. For he stood on the right hand of the poor, to save me from those who persecute my soul."

For those who work iniquity have not walked in his ways. You have commanded us diligently to keep your precepts. O that my ways were directed to keep your ordinances. Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect to all your commandments. I will give you thanks with uprightness of heart when I have learnt the judgments of your righteousness. I will keep your ordinances: O forsake me not greatly. By which shall a young man direct his way? By keeping your words. With my whole heart have I diligently sought you: cast me not away from your commandments. I have hidden your oracles in my heart, that I might not sin against you. Blessed are you, O Lord: teach me your ordinances. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of your mouth. I have delighted in the way of your testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate on your commandments and consider your ways. I will meditate on your ordinances: I will not forget your words. Render a recompense to your servant: so shall I live and keep your words. Unveil my eyes and I shall perceive the wondrous things of your law. I am a stranger in the earth: hide not your commandments from me. My soul has longed exceedingly for your judgments at all times. You have rebuked the proud: cursed are those who turn aside from your commandments. Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have sought out your testimonies. For princes sat and spoke against me: but your servant was meditating on your ordinances. For your testimonies are my meditation and your ordinances are my counselors. My soul has cleaved to the ground; revive me according to your word. I declared my ways and you did hear me: teach me your ordinances. Instruct me in the way of your ordinances; and I will meditate on your wondrous works. My soul has slumbered for weariness; strengthen me with your words. Remove from me the way of iniquity; and be merciful to me by your law. I have chosen the way of truth; and have not forgotten your judgments. I have cleaved to your testimonies, O Lord; do not put me to shame. I ran the way of your commandments when you did enlarge my heart. Teach me, O Lord, the way of your ordinances and I will seek it out continually. Instruct me and I will search out your law and keep it with my whole heart. Guide me in the path of your commandments; for I have delighted in it. Incline my heart to your testimonies and not to covetousness. Turn away my eyes that I may not behold vanity: revive me in your way. Confirm your oracle to your servant, so that he may fear you. Take away my reproach which I have feared: for your judgments are good. Behold, I have desired your commandments: revive me in your righteousness. Let your mercy come upon me, O Lord; even your salvation, according to your word. And so I shall render an answer to those who reproach me: for I have trusted in your words. And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in your judgments. So shall I keep your law continually, unto ages of ages. I walked also at large: for I sought out your commandments. I spoke of your testimonies before kings and was not ashamed. I meditated on your commandments, which I loved exceedingly. I lifted up my hands to your commandments which I loved; and I meditated in your ordinances. Remember your words to your servant, by which you have made me hope. This has comforted me in my affliction: for your oracle has revived me. The proud have transgressed exceedingly; but I swerved not from your law. I remembered your judgments of old, O Lord; and I was comforted. Despair took hold upon me, because of the sinners who forsake your law. Your ordinances were my songs in the place of my sojourning. I remembered your name, O Lord, in the night and kept your law. This I had, because I diligently sought your ordinances. You are my portion, O Lord: I said that I would keep your law. I besought your favor with my whole heart: have mercy upon me according to your word. I thought on your ways and turned my feet to your testimonies. I prepared myself, (and was not terrified,) to keep your commandments. The snares of sinners entangled me: but I forgot not your law. At midnight I arose, to give thanks to you for the judgments of your righteousness. I am a companion of all those who fear you and of those who keep your commandments. O Lord, the earth is full of your mercy: teach me your ordinances. You have accomplished kindly with your servant, O Lord, according to your word. Teach me kindness and instruction and knowledge: for I have believed your commandments. Before I was afflicted, I transgressed; therefore have I kept your word. Good are you, O Lord; therefore in your goodness teach me your ordinances. The injustice of the proud has been multiplied against me: but I will search out your commandments with all my heart. Their heart has been curdled like milk; but I have meditated on your law. It is good for me that you have afflicted me; that I might learn your ordinances. The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver."

Let those who fear you and those who know you testimonies, turn to me. Let my heart be blameless in your ordinances, that I may not be ashamed. My soul faints for your salvation: I have hoped in your words. My eyes failed in waiting for your word, saying when will you comfort me? For I have become as a bottle in the frost: yet I have not forgotten your ordinances. How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute judgment for me on those who persecute me? Transgressors told me subtleties; but not according to your law, O Lord. All your commandments are truth; they persecuted me unjustly; help me. They nearly made an end of me in the earth; but I forsook not your commandments. Revive me according to your mercy; so shall I keep the testimonies of your mouth. Your word, O Lord, abides in heaven for ever. Your truth endures to all generations; you have founded the earth and it abides. The day continues by your arrangement; for all things are your servants.

You have made me wiser than my enemies in your commandment; for it is mine for ever. I have more understanding than all my teachers; for your testimonies are my medication. I understand more that the aged; because I have sought out your commandments. I have kept back my feet from every evil way, that I might keep your words. I have not declined from your judgments; for you have instructed me. How sweet are your oracles to my throat! More so than honey to my mouth! I gain understanding by your commandments: therefore I have hated every way of unrighteousness; your law is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths. I have sworn and determined to keep the judgments of your righteousness. I have been very greatly afflicted, O Lord: revive me, according to your word. Accept, I pray you, O Lord, the freewill-offerings of my mouth and teach me your judgments. My soul is continually in your hands; and I have not forgotten your law. Sinners spread a snare for me; but I erred not from your commandments. I have inherited your testimonies for ever; for they are the joy of my heart. I have inclined my heart to perform your ordinances for ever, in return for your mercies. I have hated transgressors; but I loved your law. You are my helper and my supporter; I have hoped in your words. Depart from me, you evil-doers; for I will search out the commandments of my God. Uphold me according to your word and revive me; and make me not ashamed of my expectation. Help me and I shall be saved; and I will meditate in your ordinances continually. You have brought to nought all that depart from your ordinances; for their inward thought is unrighteous. I have reckoned all the sinners of the earth as transgressors; therefore have I loved your testimonies. Penetrate my flesh with your fear; for I am afraid of your judgments. I have done judgment and justice; deliver me not up to those who injure me. Receive your servant for good: let not the proud accuse me falsely. My eyes have failed for your salvation and for the word of your righteousness. Deal with your servant according to your mercy and teach me your ordinances. I am your servant; instruct me and I shall know your testimonies. It is time for the Lord to work: they have utterly broken your law. Therefore have I loved your commandments more than gold, or the topaz. Therefore I directed myself according to all your commandments: I have hated every unjust way. Your testimonies are wonderful: therefore my soul has sought them out. The manifestation of your words will enlighten and instruct the simple.

My eyes have been bathed in streams of water, because I have not kept your law. Righteous are you, O Lord and upright are your judgments. You have commanded righteousness and perfect truth, as your testimonies. Your zeal has quite wasted me: because my enemies have forgotten your words. Your word has been very fully tried; and your servant loves it. I am young and despised: yet I have not forgotten your ordinances. Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and your law is truth. Afflictions and distresses found me: but your commandments were my meditation. Your testimonies are an everlasting righteousness: instruct me and I shall live. I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord: I will search out your ordinances. I cried to you; save me and I will keep your testimonies. I arose before the dawn and cried: I hoped in your words. My eyes prevented the dawn, that I might meditate on your oracles. Hear my voice, O Lord, according to your mercy; revive me according to your judgment. They have drawn near who persecuted me unlawfully; and they are far removed from your law. You are near, O Lord; and all your ways are truth. I have known of old concerning your testimonies, that you have founded them for ever. Look upon my affliction and rescue me; for I have not forgotten your law. Plead my cause and ransom me: revive me because of your word. Salvation is far from sinners: for they have not searched out your ordinances. Your mercies, O Lord, are many: revive me according to your judgment. Many are those who persecute me and oppress me: but I have not declined from your testimonies. I beheld men acting foolishly and I pined away; for they kept not your oracles. Behold, I loved your commandments, O Lord: revive me in your mercy. The beginning of your words is truth; and all the judgments of your righteousness endure for ever. Princes persecuted me without a cause, but my heart feared because of your words. I will exult because of your oracles, as one that finds much spoil. I hate and abhor unrighteousness; but I love your law. Seven times in a day have I praised you because of the judgments of your righteousness. Great peace have those who love your law: and there is no stumbling-block to them. I waited for your salvation, O Lord, and loved your commandments. My soul has kept your testimonies and loved them exceedingly. I have kept your commandments and your testimonies; for all my ways are before you, O Lord. Let my supplication come near before you, O Lord; instruct me according to your oracle. Let my petition come in before you, O Lord; deliver me according to your oracle. Let my lips utter a hymn when you shall have taught me your ordinances. Let my tongue utter your oracles; for all your commandments are righteous. Let your hand be prompt to save me; for I have chosen your commandments. I have longed after your salvation, O Lord; and your law is my meditation. My soul shall live and shall praise you; and your judgments shall help me. I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant; for I have not forgotten your commandments."

For I know that the Lord is great and our Lord is above all gods; all that the Lord willed, he did in heaven and on the earth, in the sea and in all deeps. Who brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth: he has made lightnings for the rain: he brings winds out of his treasures. Who stroke the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh and on all his servants. Who stroke many nations and killed mighty kings; Seon of the Amorites, Og of Basan and all the kingdoms of C’anaan: and gave their land for an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people. O Lord, your name endures for ever and your memorial to all generations. For the Lord shall judge his people and comfort himself concerning his servants.
