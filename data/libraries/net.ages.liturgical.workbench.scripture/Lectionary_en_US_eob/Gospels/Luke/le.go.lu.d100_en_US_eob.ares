leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. After looking around at everything, since it was now evening, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve. The next day, as they were coming out from Bethany, Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find something on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. He then said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” and his disciples heard it. They arrived again in Jerusalem and Jesus entered into the temple. He began to drive out those who did business in the temple and he overthrew the tables of the money changers, as well as the seats of those who sold doves. He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple. He taught them, saying, “Is it not written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’ But you have made it a ‘den of thieves!’” When the chief priests and scribes and Pharisees heard this, they considered how they might destroy him. For they feared Jesus, because the crowd was astonished at his teaching. When evening came, he left the city. As they passed by in the morning, the disciples saw the fig tree withered from the roots. Remembering [what had happened], Peter said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away!” Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God! For amen, I tell you that if anyone tells this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ without doubt in his heart but believing that what he says is happening, he shall have whatever he says.”"
