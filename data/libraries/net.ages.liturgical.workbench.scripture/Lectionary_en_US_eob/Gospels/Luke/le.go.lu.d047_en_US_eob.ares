leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed; or hidden, that will not be known. Therefore, whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops. I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will warn you whom you should fear: fear the one who after he has killed, [also] has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins ? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore, do not be afraid! You are of more value than many sparrows. I tell you, whoever confesses me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God. But whoever denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God. Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. When you are brought before the synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not be anxious about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say; for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say.”"
