A widow lived in that city, and she often came to him, saying: ‘Defend me from my adversary!’ For a time, he would not [do anything], but after a while, he said to himself, ‘Although I neither fear God nor care for anyone, yet because this widow is bothering me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual visits.’” The Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge has to say! Will not God grant justice to his elect who are crying out to him day and night, although he exercises patience regarding them? I tell you that he will avenge them quickly!”"
