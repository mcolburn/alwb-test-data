leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, and said to the one who had invited him, “When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, brothers, kinsmen or rich neighbors because they might return the favor and pay you back. Instead, when you give a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind [to come]. Then you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to pay you back. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous.” When one of those who sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will feast in the Kingdom of God!”"
