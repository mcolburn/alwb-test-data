leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. But no one knows that day or that hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time is. It is like a man who journeyed to another country. He leaves his house, gives authority to his slaves, and to each one his task. He also instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch. Watch therefore, for you do not know when the lord of the house is coming [back], whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning. But fear that coming suddenly, he might find you sleeping. The things I tell you, I [also] tell everyone: keep watch!” It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and of the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to arrest him by deception in order to kill him. But they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people.”"
