He turned and said to them, “Anyone who comes to me and does not disregard his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters—yes, and his own life also—cannot be my disciple. And whoever does not bear his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, everyone who sees would begin to mock him, saying: ‘This fellow began to build and he was not able to finish!’ Or what king, as he goes to encounter another king in war, does not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand [troops] to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand [troops]? If he cannot, while the other [king] is still far away, he sends an embassy and asks for the conditions of peace. In the same way, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple. Salt is good, but if it becomes tasteless, what can make it salty again? It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile and it is thrown out! Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”"
