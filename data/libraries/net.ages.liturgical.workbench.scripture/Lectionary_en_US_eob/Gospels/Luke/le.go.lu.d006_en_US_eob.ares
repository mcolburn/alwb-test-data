leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching the people on the Sabbath day, and they were astonished at his teaching because his word was with authority. In the synagogue, there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Ah! What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!” Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” When the demon had thrown the man among them, he came out of him, having done him no harm. Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!”"
