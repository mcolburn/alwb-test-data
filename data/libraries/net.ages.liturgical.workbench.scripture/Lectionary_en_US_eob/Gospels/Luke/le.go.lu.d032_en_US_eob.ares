leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, one of his disciples came to him and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your Name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us.” Jesus said to him, “Do not forbid him, for he is not against us. For whoever is not against us is for us.” It came to pass, when the days were near for him to be taken up, that he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem, and he sent messengers ahead of him. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans in order to make preparation for him. But the people did not receive him because he was heading for Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, just as Elias did?” But Jesus turned around and rebuked them. And they went on to another village."
