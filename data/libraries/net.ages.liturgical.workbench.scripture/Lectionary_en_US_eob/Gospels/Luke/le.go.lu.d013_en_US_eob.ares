leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was [present] to heal the people. Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. Not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles with his cot, right in the center, in front of Jesus. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to him, “Man, your sins are forgiven you.” The scribes and the Pharisees began to think about this, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?” But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts in such a way? Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’ However, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” (he said to the paralyzed man), “I tell you, arise, take up your cot, and go to your house.” Immediately, the man rose up before them and took up what he was lying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. Amazement took hold of all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today!”"
