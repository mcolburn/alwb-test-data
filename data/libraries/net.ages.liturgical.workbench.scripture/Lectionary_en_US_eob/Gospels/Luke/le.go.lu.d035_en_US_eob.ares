leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, feasting in luxury every day. A certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, who desired to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even dogs came and licked his sores. It happened that the beggar died and that he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. In hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom. He cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue! For I am in agony in this flame!’ But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime, you received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now, he is comforted here and you are in anguish. Besides all this, between us and you a great gulf is fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot [do so], and that no one may cross over from there to us.’ He said, ‘I ask you therefore, father, that you would send Lazarus to my father’s house; for I have five brothers, that he might bear witness to them, so that they would not also come to this place of torment.’ Abraham replied to him, ‘They have Moses and the prophets! Let them listen to them!’ But he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ Then Abraham said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.’ ”"
