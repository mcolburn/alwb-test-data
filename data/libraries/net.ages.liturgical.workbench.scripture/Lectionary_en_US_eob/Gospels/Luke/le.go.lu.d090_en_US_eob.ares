leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, and they were watching him [closely]. And behold, a certain man who had swollen arms and legs was [standing] in front of him. Jesus answered and spoke to the experts in the law and to the Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, Jesus healed him and sent him away. He answered them, “Which of you, if your son or ox falls into a well on a Sabbath day, would not immediately pull it out?” And they could not answer him regarding these things. When Jesus noticed how people chose the best seats, he told the guest a parable, saying, “When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, do not sit in the best seat. It could be that someone more honorable than you might have been invited by the host, and he who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this person.’ Then, with shame, you would proceed to take the lowest place. Instead, when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place. And so, when the host comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher!’ Then you will be honored in the presence of those who sit at the table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”"
