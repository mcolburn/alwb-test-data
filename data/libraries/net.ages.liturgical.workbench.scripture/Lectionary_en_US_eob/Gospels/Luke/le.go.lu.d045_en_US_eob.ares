You should have done these while not leaving the other undone. Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like hidden graves, and people who walk over them do not [even] know it.” One of the experts in the law exclaimed, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.” Jesus said, “Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves will not even lift one finger to help carry those burdens!”"
