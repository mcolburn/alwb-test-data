leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, an expert in the law came to Jesus and put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus answered, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?” The man answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” Jesus said to him, “You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.” But the lawyer, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” Then Jesus answered, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes and beat him. Then they went away, leaving him half dead. By chance, a certain priest was going down that way. But when the priest saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way, a Levite also came to the place, but when he saw the beaten man, he [also] passed by on the other side. Now a certain Samaritan was traveling and arrived at the spot where the man was. When the Samaritan saw the wounded man, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and wrapped his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He placed the man on his own animal and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he was leaving, he took out two denarii and gave them to the host, saying to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will pay you back when I return.’ Now which one of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” The lawyer replied, “The one who showed mercy on him!” Then Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”"
