leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Beware of the scribes! They like to walk in long robes, to be greeted in the marketplace, and [to have] the best seats in the synagogues and at banquets. They devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense say long prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.” Jesus sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting their money into the treasury. Many who were rich gave much. A poor widow came, and she put in two small coins, which amount to a quadrans coin. He called his disciples to himself, and told them, “Amen, I tell you that this poor widow gave more than all those [others] who are giving to the treasury. For they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”"
