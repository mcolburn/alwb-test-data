leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Be careful! If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven times in the day, and comes back seven times, saying: ‘I repent!’ you must forgive him.” The apostles also said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” The Lord said, “If you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted and transplanted into the sea,’ and it would obey you! Now who is there among you, having a slave plowing or sheepherding, that will say when that slave returns from the field, ‘Come at once and sit down at the table.’ Instead, will you not tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me while I eat and drink. Afterwards, you may eat and drink’? Does the master thank that slave because he did the things that were commanded? I think not! So you also, when you have done all those things which you are commanded [to do], say, ‘We are unworthy slaves; we have [only] done our duty!’”"
