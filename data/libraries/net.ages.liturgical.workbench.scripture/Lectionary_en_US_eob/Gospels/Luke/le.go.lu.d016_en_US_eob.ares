leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free. Give, and it will be given to you: a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing will be given to you. For with the same measure [that] you measure, it will be measured back to you.” He spoke a parable to them. “Can the blind guide the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above his teacher, but after being fully trained, everyone will be like their teacher. Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye but do not consider the beam that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you do not see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrites! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will be able to see clearly in order to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye. For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit, or any rotten tree that produces good fruit. Indeed, each tree is recognized by its own fruit! People do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick up grapes from a bramble bush. Out of the good treasure of his heart, a good person brings out what is good, but out of the evil treasure of his heart, one who is evil brings out what is evil. For out of the overflowing of the heart, the mouth speaks.”"
