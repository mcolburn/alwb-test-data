leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) came to Jesus. They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man dies leaving a wife behind him but no children, his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for him.’ Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, died, and left no offspring. The second [brother] took her and [also] died, and left no children behind him, either. The third likewise; and so the seven [brothers] married her and left no children. Last of all, the woman also died. Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven [brothers] had her as a wife.” Jesus answered them, “Is this not why you are mistaken, by not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God? For when people rise from the dead, they do not marry nor are given in marriage; instead, they are like angels in heaven. But regarding the fact that the dead are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses (in the passage about the bush), how God spoke to him, saying: ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living! This is why you are greatly misled.”"
