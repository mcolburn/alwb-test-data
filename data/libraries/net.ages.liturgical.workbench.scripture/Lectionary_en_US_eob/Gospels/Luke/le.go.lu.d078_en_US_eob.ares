leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, some of the Sadducees came to Jesus, those who say there is no resurrection. They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man dies having a wife and he dies without children, his brother should take the wife and raise up a posterity for his brother. There were therefore seven brothers: the first took a wife and died childless. The second took her as wife, and he [also] died childless. The third took her, and likewise all seven [brothers] left no children and died. Afterwards, the woman also died. Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife is she? For the seven had her as wife.” Jesus answered and said to them, “The children of this age get married and are given in marriage. But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead do not marry or are given in marriage. They cannot die any more, because they are like the angels, and they are children of God, being children of the resurrection. But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed in the [story of the burning] bush, when he called the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, because all are alive to him!” Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you speak well!” After that, they did not dare to ask him any more questions. Jesus asked them, “Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son? David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.’ David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?”"
