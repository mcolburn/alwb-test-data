leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, some [ Jews] were present who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way! Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell. Do you think that they were worse offenders than all those who live in Jerusalem? I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did!” He then said this parable. “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came to look for fruit on it, but found nothing. He said to the vine dresser, ‘Behold, I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree for three years, and found none. Cut it down! Why does it waste the soil?’ The gardener answered, ‘Lord, let it be for this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’ ”"
