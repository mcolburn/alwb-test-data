leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions. He called his manager and told him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your stewardship, for you can no longer be [my] steward.’ The manager said within himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I do not have strength to dig! I am ashamed to beg! I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’ Calling each one of his lord’s debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my lord?’ The man replied, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ The manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly and write fifty.’ Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ That one replied, ‘A hundred cors of wheat.’ And the manager said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’ His master praised the dishonest manager because he had acted wisely, for the children of this world are wiser than the children of the light in [dealing with] their own kind. I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon , so that when you fail, you may be received into the eternal dwellings.”"
