For everyone who asks receives. Whoever seeks finds. To the one who knocks it will be opened. Who among you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if a son asks for a fish, the father will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? Or if a son asks for an egg, the father will not give him a scorpion, will he? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give a good spirit to those who ask him!”"
