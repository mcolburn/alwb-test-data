leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the Kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to those in need. Make for yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief can reach and where moth cannot destroy. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Be dressed in readiness and keep your lamps burning. Be like people waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast, ready to open the door as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed are those slaves whom the lord will find watching when he comes! Amen, I tell you: he will dress himself [to serve], make them recline, and he will come to serve them! And if the master comes in the second or third watch and finds them doing so, blessed are those servants. But know this, that if the master of the house had known when the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect him.”"
