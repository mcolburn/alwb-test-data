leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. And so, you testify and consent to the works of your fathers! For they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. Therefore, the wisdom of God also said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles. Some of them they will kill and drive out , so that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you that this generation will be charged with this blood. Woe to you experts of the law! You have taken away the key to knowledge; you yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.” As he said these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began a furious attack on him and tried to force answers from him on many questions. They were lying in wait for him, seeking to catch him in something he might say, in order to accuse him. Meanwhile, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, to the point that they trampled on each other. Jesus began to speak, first of all to his disciples, “Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy.”"
