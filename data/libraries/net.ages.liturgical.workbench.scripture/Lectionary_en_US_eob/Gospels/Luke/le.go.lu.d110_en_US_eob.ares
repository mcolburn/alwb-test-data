leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look! What [amazing] stones and buildings!” Jesus answered and said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” As he sat on the Mount of Olives facing the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him in private, “Tell us, when will these things take place? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?” Then Jesus, answering them, began to say, “Be careful that no one leads you astray! For many will come in my Name, saying: ‘I am he! ’ and they will lead many astray. But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. Those things must take place, but the end is not [there] yet. Indeed, nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom! There will be earthquakes in various places, as well as famines and troubles. These things are [only] the beginnings of birth pains."
