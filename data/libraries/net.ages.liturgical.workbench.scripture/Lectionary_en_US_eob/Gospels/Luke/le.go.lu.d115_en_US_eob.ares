leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “In those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. Then people will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. After that, he will send out his angels and [they] will gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky. Learn this parable from the fig tree. When the branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near! Likewise, when you see these things taking place, know that it is near, at the doors! Amen, I tell you: this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”"
