leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “A certain man gave a great banquet and invited many people. At supper time, he sent out his slaves to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is ready now!’ But they all began to make excuses. The first told him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused!’ Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen and I must go try them out. Please have me excused!’ Another said, ‘I have just been married, and therefore I cannot come!’ That slave came back and reported these things to his lord. At this, the master of the house became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.’ The servant said, ‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room!’ The lord then told the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled! For I tell you that none of those who were invited will taste of my supper.’ For many are called, but few are chosen.”"
