leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, while Jesus was in one of the cities, behold there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, “I want to! Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him. Jesus commanded him to tell no one: “But go your way, show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.” Still, the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. However, Jesus withdrew into the desert and prayed."
