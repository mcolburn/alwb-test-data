Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. Nothing is secret that will not be known and come to light. Therefore, be careful how you hear. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.” His mother and brothers came to him, but they could not come near him because of the crowd. It was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.” But Jesus answered, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”"
