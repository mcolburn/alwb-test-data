leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his Disciples: “Beware of the scribes who like to walk in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts. They devour the houses of widows and for a pretense say long prayers: they will receive greater condemnation!” Looking up, Jesus saw the rich who were putting their gifts into the treasury. Then he saw a certain poor widow casting in two small brass coins. He said, “Amen, I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than all of them! For all these [people] put in gifts for God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on.” As he said this, he exclaimed, “Let anyone with ears to hear listen.”"
