leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office. Jesus said to him, “Follow me!” Levi left everything, got up and began to follow Jesus. He made a great feast for Jesus in his house. A great crowd of tax collectors was [assembled] there, and other people were also reclining at the table with them. The scribes and the Pharisees murmured against Jesus’ disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?” Jesus answered them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do! I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”"
