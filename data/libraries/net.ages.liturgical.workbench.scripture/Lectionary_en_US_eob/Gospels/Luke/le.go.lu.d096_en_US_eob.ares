leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples, “How hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the Kingdom of God!” They were extremely astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and answered, “With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God!” Peter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you.” So Jesus replied, “Amen, I tell you: there is no one who has left house, brothers or sisters, father or mother, or wife, children, or land, for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, who will not receive a hundred times more in this time: houses, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, children, and land, (with persecutions); and in the age to come eternal life. But many who are first will be last; and the last [will be] first.” They were on their way up to Jerusalem, and as Jesus was going in front of them, they were stunned; and those who followed were afraid."
