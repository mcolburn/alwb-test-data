No sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, the Son of Man will also be a sign to this generation. The Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment along with the people of this generation, and she will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here! The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and they will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here. No one who has lit a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket! Instead, it is placed on a stand so that those who come in may see the light.”"
