When they are already budding, you see it and know on your own that the summer is already near. Likewise, when you see these things happening, understand that the Kingdom of God is near. Amen, I tell you: this generation will not pass away until all [these] things are accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”"
