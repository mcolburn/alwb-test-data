leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “The Kingdom of God is like a grain of mustard seed which someone picked up and planted in his own garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air found shelter in its branches.” Again he said, “To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God? It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.” Jesus was on his way through cities and villages, teaching and traveling onward to Jerusalem. Someone asked him, “Lord, are those who are saved [only] a few?” Jesus replied, “Do your utmost to enter in by the narrow gate! For I tell you that many will try to enter, but they will not be able. Once the master of the house has risen up and shut the door, you will stand outside and knock on the door, saying: ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ But then, he will answer, ‘I do not know you or where you come from!’ Then you will start saying, ‘We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets!’ But the master will reply, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from! Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.’ In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside. People will come from the east, west, north, and south, and they will have a place in the Kingdom of God."
