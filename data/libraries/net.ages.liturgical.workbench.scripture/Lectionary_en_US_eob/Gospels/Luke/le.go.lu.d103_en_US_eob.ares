leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable, “A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower. He then rented it to tenant farmers and left for another country. When it was time, he sent a slave to the farmers to receive his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But they took the slave, beat him, and sent him away empty. Again, the owner sent another slave to them, and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. Again he sent another; and they killed him along with many others, beating some, and killing some. The man still had one left to send, his beloved son. Finally, he sent him to them, saying: ‘They will respect my son!’ But the tenants of the vineyard saw him coming and said among themselves, ‘This is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!’ They took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. What then will the lord of the vineyard do?” “He will come to destroy those farmers, and he will give the vineyard to others.” “Have you not even read this Scripture:‘The very stone which the builders rejected, Has become the head of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes?’ ” They kept trying to arrest Jesus, but they feared the multitude because they understood that he had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away."
