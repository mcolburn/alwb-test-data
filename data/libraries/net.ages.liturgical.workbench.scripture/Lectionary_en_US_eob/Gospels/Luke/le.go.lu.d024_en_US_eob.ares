But as they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A windstorm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. His disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Master, master, we are perishing!” Jesus awoke, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm. He said to them, “Where is your faith?” In fear and amazement, they said to one another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”"
