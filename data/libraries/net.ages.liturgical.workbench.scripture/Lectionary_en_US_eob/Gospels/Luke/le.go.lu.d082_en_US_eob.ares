leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, every day, Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every evening, he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet. Then early in the morning, all the people came to him in the temple in order to listen to him. Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to do away with Jesus [by killing him], but they feared the people. Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the Twelve. So Judas went and talked with the chief priests and scribes and officers of the guard about how he might deliver Jesus to them. They rejoiced and agreed to give him money. Judas agreed and began to look for an opportunity to deliver him to them when there would be no crowd. Then the day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat [the Passover meal].”"
