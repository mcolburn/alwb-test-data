leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, one of the scribes came to Jesus, and heard the Sadducees debating him. Knowing that Jesus had answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”Jesus answered him, “The greatest is, ‘Hear Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one: you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ This is the first commandment. And the second is likewise, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” The scribe said to him, “It is well, teacher, that you have said truly that he is one, and there is none other but he, and to love him with the whole heart, with the whole mind, with the whole soul, and with the whole strength; and to love one’s neighbor as oneself. It is more important than any whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.” When Jesus saw that the scribe had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the Kingdom of God!” No one dared to ask him any [other] question after that. As he taught in the temple, Jesus asked, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? For David himself said in the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet. Therefore, David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son? The large crowd listened to him with delight.”"
