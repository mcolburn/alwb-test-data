leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a certain ruler came to Jesus saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus asked him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one—God. You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’” The ruler replied, “I have observed all these things from my youth.” When Jesus heard these things, he said, “You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, distribute it to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” But when the man heard these things, he became very distressed because he was very rich. Jesus, seeing that he had become very distressed, said, “How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter into the Kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is wealthy to enter into the Kingdom of God!” Those who heard this exclaimed, “Then who can be saved?” But Jesus replied, “The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”"
