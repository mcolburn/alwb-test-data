leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus entered into Capernaum. There was the slave of a certain centurion, a man highly valued by his master, who was sick and at the point of death. When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him presbyters of the Jews to ask him to come and save his slave. When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, saying, “This man deserves to have you do this because he loves our nation and [even] built our synagogue for us.” Jesus went along with them, but as he was approaching the house, the centurion sent word to him (by some friends to say to him), “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. Therefore, I did not even think myself worthy to come to you. But [only] say the word and my servant will be healed. For I am also a man placed under authority, and I have soldiers under my command. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him. Turning around, he said to the multitude who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel!” And the messengers, returning to the house, found that the slave who had been sick was [now] well."
