leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, calling his twelve disciples together, Jesus gave them power and authority over all demons, and [power] to cure diseases. He then sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick. Jesus said to them, “Do not take anything for the journey—no staffs, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic. Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave from that place. Wherever people do not welcome you, shake the very dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them.” They departed and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere."
