Neither will people say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you.” Jesus told the disciples, “The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. And people will tell you, ‘Look there, look here!’ Do not go away or follow [them], for as the lightning that flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so also will the Son of Man be in his day. But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.”"
