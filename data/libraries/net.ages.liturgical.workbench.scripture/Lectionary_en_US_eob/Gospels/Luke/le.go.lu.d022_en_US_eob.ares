leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat at the table. And behold, a woman who was a sinner in the city, when she learned that he was reclining at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume. Standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head. She also kissed his feet and anointed them with the perfumed oil. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have perceived who is touching him and what kind of woman this is, that she is a sinner.” Jesus said to him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” He replied, “Speak, teacher.” “A certain lender had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they could not pay, he forgave them both. Tell me then, which of them will love him the most?” Simon answered, “The one to whom he forgave the most I suppose.” Jesus said to him, “You have judged correctly.” Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet; but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped [them] with the hair of her head. You gave me no kiss, but since the time I came in, she has not ceased kissing my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume. Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven because she has loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.” Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” Then Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”"
