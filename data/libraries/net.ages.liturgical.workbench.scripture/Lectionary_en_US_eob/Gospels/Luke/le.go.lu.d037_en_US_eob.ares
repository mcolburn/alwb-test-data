leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus had finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.” Jesus said to them, “When you pray, say: ‘Our Father in heaven, may your Name be kept holy! May your Kingdom come! May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven. Give us day by day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’ ” He said to them, “Suppose [that] one of you has a friend. You go to this friend’s house at midnight and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread! A friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’ Then the one inside answers and says, ‘Do not bother me! The door is now shut and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything!’ I tell you, although he will not get up and give [any loaves] to him because they are friends, yet because of the requester’s bold persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs. I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives. Whoever seeks finds. To the one who knocks it will be opened.”"
