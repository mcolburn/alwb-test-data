No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, or who the Father is, except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” Turning to the disciples, Jesus said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but they did not see them; and to hear what you hear, but they did not hear them.”"
