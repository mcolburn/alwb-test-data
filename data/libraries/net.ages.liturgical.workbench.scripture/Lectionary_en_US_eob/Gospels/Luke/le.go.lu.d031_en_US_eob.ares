leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.” But they did not understand this saying; it was concealed from them so that they should not understand its meaning, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. A dispute sprang up among them about which [one] of them was the greatest. Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child and set him by his side. He then said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my Name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is the least among you all, this one is great.” John said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your Name, and we tried to stop him because he does not follow with us.” Jesus said to him, “Do not forbid him, for he is not against us. For whoever is not against us is for us.”"
