leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus the blind man, sat by the road begging. When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, “Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!” Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet. But Bartimaeus cried out even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. They called the blind man and said to him, “Cheer up! Get up, he is calling you!” Having thrown his cloak aside, he got up and came to Jesus. Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man replied, “Rabboni, that I may see again!” Jesus said to him, “Be on your way! Your faith has made you well.” At once, the man received his sight and followed Jesus along the way."
