leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, and when he was in the house, he asked his disciples, “What were you arguing about among yourselves on the way?” However, they remained silent because on the way, they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. He sat down, called the Twelve, and told them, “If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and the servant of all.” He took a little child and set him in their midst. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, “Whoever receives such a little child in my Name, receives me; and whoever receives me, does not receive me, but the one who sent me.” Now John answered him, “Teacher, we have seen someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your Name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow us!” But Jesus said, “Do not forbid him, for no one who does a mighty work in my Name will be able to quickly speak evil of me. Whoever is not against us is on our side! Amen, I tell you that whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my Name, because you belong to Christ, will not lose his reward."
