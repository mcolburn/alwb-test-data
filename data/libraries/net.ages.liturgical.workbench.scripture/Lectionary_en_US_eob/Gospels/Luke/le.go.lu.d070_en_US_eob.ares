leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. Behold, there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten herself up. When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity!” He laid his hands on her and immediately, she stood up straight and glorified God. However, the ruler of the synagogue was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. He said to the crowd, “There are six days in which people should work! Therefore, come on those days and be healed, not on the Sabbath day!” Then the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead it out to water? Should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham who was bound by Satan for eighteen years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?” As he said these things, all his adversaries were put to shame and all the people rejoiced over all the glorious things that were done by him."
