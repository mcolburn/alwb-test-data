leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “As it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man. People ate, drank, got married and were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered into the ark; and the flood came, destroying them all. Likewise, as it also happened in the days of Lot: people ate, drank, bought, sold, planted and built. But in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky which destroyed them all. It will be the same in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. In that day, whoever is on the housetop, [having] his goods in the house, should not go down to take them away! Likewise, whoever is in the field should not return. Remember Lot’s wife! Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. I tell you that in that night, there will be two people in one bed! One will be taken, and the other will be left. There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left. Two will be in the field: one will be taken, and the other left.” In reply, the disciples asked him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the body is, there the eagles will also be assembled. And yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the land?”"
