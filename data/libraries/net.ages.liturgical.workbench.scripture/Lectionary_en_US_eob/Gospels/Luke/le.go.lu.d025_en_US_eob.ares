leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Jesus. He was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead. Some said that Elias had appeared, and others that one of the old prophets had risen again. Herod said, “I have beheaded John, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he desired to see Jesus. When they returned, the apostles told him what things they had done. Then Jesus took them with him, and they withdrew to a deserted place [which was part] of a city called Bethsaida. However, the crowd perceived this and followed him. Jesus received them, speaking to them about the Kingdom of God, and curing those who needed healing."
