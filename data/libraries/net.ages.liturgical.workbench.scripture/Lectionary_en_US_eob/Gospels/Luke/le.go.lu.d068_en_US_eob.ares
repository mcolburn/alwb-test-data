leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return. So he called ten of his slaves, gave them ten mina coins, and told them, ‘Do business [with these] until I come.’ But his subjects hated him, and they sent a delegation after him to say: ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’ It so happened that when he returned after receiving the kingdom, he commanded these slaves to whom he had given the money to be called to him, so that he might know what they had earned by conducting business. The first came before him, saying: ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas!’ The king said to him, ‘Well done, you good slave! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’ The second came, saying: ‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas!’ And so, the king said to him, ‘And you are to be set over five cities.’ Another came, saying: ‘Lord, behold, [here is] your mina, which I kept laid away in a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you are a strict man! You take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter.’ The king said to him, ‘Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked slave! You perceived that I was a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow, and gathering where I did not scatter. Why then did you not place my money on deposit, and at my coming, I would have collected it with interest on it?’ He then said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’ At this, they said to the master, ‘Lord, he [already] has ten minas!’ ‘For I tell you that to everyone who [already] has, more will be given; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. As for those enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and kill them before me.’ ” Having said these things, Jesus went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
