leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples, “But when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it should not stand (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea should flee to the mountains. Then whoever is on the housetop should not go down into the house or enter in to take anything out of the house. He who is in the field should not come back to take his cloak. But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days! Pray that your flight will not be in the winter! For in those days, there will be oppression such as there has not been since the beginning of God’s creation until now, and never will be. If the Lord had not cut those days short, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect whom he chose, he has shortened the days. Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show signs and wonders in order to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. You, therefore, must be on your guard. Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.”"
