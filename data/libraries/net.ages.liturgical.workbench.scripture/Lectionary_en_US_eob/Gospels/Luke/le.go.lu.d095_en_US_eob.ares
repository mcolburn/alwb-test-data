leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was setting out on his journey, someone ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do in order to inherit eternal life?” Jesus replied, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one: God. You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’” The man replied, “Teacher, I have observed all these things since my youth!” Jesus looked at him and felt love for him. He then said, “You [still] lack one thing. If you want to be perfect , go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor. You will have a treasure in heaven! Then come and follow me, taking up the cross.” However, the man was distressed when he heard this. He went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it is for the wealthy to enter into the Kingdom of God!” The disciples were amazed at his words. But again, Jesus said, “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the Kingdom of God!” They were extremely astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and answered, “With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God!”"
