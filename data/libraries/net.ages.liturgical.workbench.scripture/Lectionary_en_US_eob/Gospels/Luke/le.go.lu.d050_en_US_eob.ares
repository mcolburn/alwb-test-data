leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was teaching, someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me!” But Jesus replied, “Friend, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?” He said to them, “Beware! Keep yourselves from all covetousness, for a person’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. Therefore, I tell you not to be anxious about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. No, life is more than food and the body is more than clothing! Consider the ravens: they do not sow, they do not reap, they do not have a warehouse or barn, and [yet] God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! Which one of you by worrying can add a single day to his life? If you are not able to accomplish even the smallest things, why then are you anxious about the rest? Consider the lilies, how they grow. They do not toil or spin; yet, I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if this is how God clothes the grass of the field, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith? Do not set your hearts on what you will eat and drink; do not be apprehensive. It is the pagan world that runs after all these things, and your Father understands that you need them. Seek rather the Kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you.”"
