Nevertheless, I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.’ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [the one] that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often have I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! Behold, your house is left to you desolate! I tell you, you will not see me, until [the time] comes when you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord!’ ”"
