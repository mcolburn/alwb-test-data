leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus was casting out a demon which was mute, and when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke and the people were amazed. However, some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons!” Others put him to the test and asked from him a sign from heaven. But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls. If Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul! But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges. However, if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you! When a strong man is fully armed and guards his own house, his goods are safe. But when someone stronger attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils. Whoever is not with me is against me! Whoever does not gather with me scatters!"
