leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus reached the country of the Gadarenes, a man from the town who had had demons for a long time came to meet him. This man wore no clothes, and he did not live in a house, but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him. With a loud voice, he said, “What do you want from me, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!” (For Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man). The unclean spirit had often seized the man and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and fetters. [But he had been] breaking the chains and was driven by the demon into deserted places. Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He replied, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him. And he begged Jesus not to command them to go into the abyss. Now there was a large herd of swine feeding on the mountain, and the demons begged him that he would allow them to enter into those [pigs]; and Jesus allowed them. The demons came out from the man and entered into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and [the swine] were drowned. When the people who fed the pigs saw what had happened, they fled and told the story in the city and in the countryside. Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out. He was sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been delivered. All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because they were extremely afraid. So he got into the boat and went back. The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with Jesus, but Jesus sent him away, saying: “Return to your house and proclaim what great things God has done for you.” So the man went on his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him."
