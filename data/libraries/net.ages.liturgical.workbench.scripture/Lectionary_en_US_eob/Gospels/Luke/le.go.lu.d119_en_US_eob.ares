leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “A certain man had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will come to me.’ So the father divided his livelihood between them. A few days later, the younger son gathered all that he had and traveled to a far country. There, he squandered his property, living immorally. When he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he began to be in need. He went and hired himself to one of the citizens of that country who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. He wanted to feed himself with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough to spare, and I am dying with hunger! I will get up, go to my father, and tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son! Make me as one of your hired servants.”’ So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still at a distance, his father saw him and was moved with compassion. He ran, and embraced his son, and kissed him. Then the son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you! I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his slaves, ‘Bring out the first robe and put it on him! Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet! Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; for this, my son, was dead, and he is alive again! He was lost and [now he] is found!’ And they began to celebrate. Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing. Calling one of the servants, he asked what was going on. The servant replied, ‘Your brother has returned! Your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’ However, the elder son became angry and he would not go in. Therefore, his father came out and begged him. But he answered his father, ‘Look, for so many years I have served you, and I have never disobeyed a commandment of yours. Yet, you never gave me a goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this, your son, arrived, he who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’ The father said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours! But it was fitting to celebrate and to rejoice, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost and is found!’”"
