leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a man named Jairus came to Jesus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged him to come to his house because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. But as Jesus went, the crowd pressed against him. There was a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and who had spent all she had on physicians, but she could not be healed by any. She came behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak. Immediately, the flow of her blood stopped. Jesus said, “Who touched me?” As everyone was denying it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you, and you ask, ‘Who touched me?’” But Jesus said, “Someone has touched me, for I perceived that power has gone out from me.” When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came forth trembling. Falling down before Jesus, in the presence of all the people, she confessed to him why she had touched him, and how she had immediately been healed. He said to her, “Daughter, be of good cheer! Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.” But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, “Do not be afraid! Only believe, and she will be healed.” When Jesus arrived at the house, he did not allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, and James, as well as the father of the child and her mother. All were weeping and mourning the girl, but Jesus said, “Do not weep! She is not dead, but sleeping.” But they mocked him, knowing that she was dead. Jesus put them all outside, and taking the girl by the hand, he called, “Child, arise!” Her spirit returned, and she immediately got up. He ordered that something to eat should be given to her. Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done."
