leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the presbyters, the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He spoke to them openly. Peter took him [aside] and began to rebuke him. But Jesus, turning around and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, “Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.” Jesus called the multitude to himself with his disciples and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.”"
