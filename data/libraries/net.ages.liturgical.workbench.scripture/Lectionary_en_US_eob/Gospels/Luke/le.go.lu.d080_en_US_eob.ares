What is the sign that these things are about to happen?” Jesus replied, “Watch out that you do not get led astray. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be fearful events and great signs from heaven. But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains! Let those who are in the midst of her depart! Let those who are in the countryside not enter in [the city]. For these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written may be fulfilled. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and will be taken away as captives into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.”"
