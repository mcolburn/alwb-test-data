But it will turn out for you as an occasion to bear witness. Therefore, settle it in your hearts not to ponder in advance how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or withstand. You will be handed over even by parents, relatives, friends, and brothers. Some of you will be put to death. You will be hated by all for my Name’s sake, yet not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance acquire your lives.”"
