I do not have room to store my crops!’ Then the man said, ‘This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns, build bigger ones, and there I will store all my crops and my goods. Then I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many goods stored up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry!”’ But God said to him, ‘You fool! Tonight your soul is demanded of you. The things which you have prepared, to whom will they belong?’ This is how it is when someone amasses treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.” As he said this, he exclaimed, “Let anyone with ears to hear listen!”"
