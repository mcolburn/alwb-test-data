leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another [woman] commits adultery against her. And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.” And people were bringing little children to him so that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who were bringing them. But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, “Let the little children come to me and do not forbid them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Amen, I tell you that whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will in no way enter into it!” He took the children in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them."
