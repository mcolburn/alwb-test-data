leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus was walking through the grain fields on the Sabbath. His disciples plucked heads of grain and ate them, rubbing the heads in their hands. But some among the Pharisees asked them, “Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?” Jesus answered them with these words: “Have not you read what David did when he was hungry, along with those who were with him? How he entered into the house of God, took and ate the bread of the Presence and also gave it to those who were with him, even though it is not lawful to eat [from it] except for the priests alone?” He said to them, “The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.” Now it also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and began to teach. A man was there whose right hand was withered. The scribes and the Pharisees were watching, to see if Jesus would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. But he perceived their thoughts. He said to the man who had the withered hand, “Rise up, and stand in the midst [of all];” and the man arose and stood up. Then Jesus said to them, “I will ask you something: Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” He looked around at all of them and said to him, “Stretch out your hand!” The man did so, and his hand was restored like the other."
