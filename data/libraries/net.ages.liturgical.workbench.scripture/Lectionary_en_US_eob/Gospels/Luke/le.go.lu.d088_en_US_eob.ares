leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples kept the saying of Jesus to themselves, wondering what “rising from the dead” meant. They asked him, “Why do the scribes say that Elias must come first?” Jesus answered, “Indeed, Elias comes first and restores all things. Why then is it written about the Son of Man that he must suffer many things and be despised? But I tell you that Elias has [already] come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.” Returning to the [other] disciples, Jesus saw a great crowd around them, and scribes were questioning them. At once, when all the people saw him, they were greatly amazed and rushed to greet him."
