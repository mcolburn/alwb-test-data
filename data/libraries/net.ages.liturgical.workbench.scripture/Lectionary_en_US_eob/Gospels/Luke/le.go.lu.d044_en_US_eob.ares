leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “The lamp of the body is the eye! Therefore, when your eye is healthy, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness! And so, see whether the light that is in you is not darkness. If your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, it will be completely full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.” Now as Jesus was speaking these things, a certain Pharisee asked him to have dinner with him. Jesus went in and reclined at the table. When the Pharisee saw it, he was astonished that Jesus had not first washed himself before dinner. But the Lord said to him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and platter, but your inside is full of extortion and wickedness. You fools! Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside? But as for what is inside you, be generous to the needy, and behold, all things will be clean to you.”"
