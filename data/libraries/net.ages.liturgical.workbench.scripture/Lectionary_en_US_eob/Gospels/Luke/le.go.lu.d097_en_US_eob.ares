leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Whoever is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much. Whoever is dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much. Therefore, if you have not been faithful with unrighteous mammon, who will entrust you with true riches? If you have not been faithful in what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate one and love the other; or else he will be attached to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.” Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him. Jesus told them, “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of people, but God knows your hearts. Indeed, what is exalted among people is an abomination in the sight of God."
