leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night, in prayer to God. When day came, he called his disciples and chose twelve from among them, which he also named ‘apostles’: Simon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; Judas [the brother] of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor. He came down with them and stood on a level place. A number of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea, Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those who were troubled by unclean spirits also came, and they were healed. The whole multitude desired to touch him because power came out from him and healed them all."
