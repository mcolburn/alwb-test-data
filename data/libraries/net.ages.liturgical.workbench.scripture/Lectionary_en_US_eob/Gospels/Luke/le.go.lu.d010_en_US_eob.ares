leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees came to Jesus and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?” Jesus said to them, “Can you make the guests of the wedding fast, while the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.” He also told them a parable: “No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. Instead, new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. No one who has drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better!’ ”"
