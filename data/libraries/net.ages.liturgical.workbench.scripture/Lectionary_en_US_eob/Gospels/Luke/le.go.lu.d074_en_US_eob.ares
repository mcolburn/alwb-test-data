leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “A certain man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time. At the proper season, he sent a slave to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat the servant and sent him away with nothing. The owner then sent to them yet another slave, and they also beat him, treated him with contempt, and sent him away empty. He sent yet a third [servant], and they also wounded him, and threw him out. Then the lord of the vineyard thought, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son! It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’ But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying: ‘This is the heir! Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.’ So, they threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. Now what will the lord of the vineyard do to them? He will come and destroy these farmers, and he will give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they exclaimed, “May it never be!” But Jesus looked at them and said, “Then what is this that is written: ‘The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone?’ Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush to dust whoever it falls on.”"
