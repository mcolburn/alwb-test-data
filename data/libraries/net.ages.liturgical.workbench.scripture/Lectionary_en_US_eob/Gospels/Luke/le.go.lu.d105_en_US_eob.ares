leluLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through town. There was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was, and could not because of the crowd, for he was short. He ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was [about] to pass that way. When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, saw Zacchaeus, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house!” He hurried, came down, and received Jesus with joy. But when the people saw it, they all grumbled, saying, “He has gone in to stay with a man who is a sinner!” Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have wrongfully obtained money from anyone, I restore four times as much!” Then Jesus said to him, “Today, salvation has come to this house, because he, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.”"
