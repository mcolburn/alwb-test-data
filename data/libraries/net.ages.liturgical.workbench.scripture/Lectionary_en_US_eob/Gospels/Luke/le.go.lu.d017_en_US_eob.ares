He is like a man building a house who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the water rushed against that house but could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock. But the one who hears and does not practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The stream rushed against it, and at once it fell down; and the ruin of that house was great.” Now when Jesus had finished speaking all that he wanted the people to hear, he entered into Capernaum."
