leluLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of people, but God knows your hearts. Indeed, what is exalted among people is an abomination in the sight of God. The law and the prophets were [proclaimed] until John [came]. Since then, the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone enters into it with a struggle. Yet, it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall [out]. Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another [woman] commits adultery; and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” Then he told his disciples, “It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to the one through whom they come! It would be better for such a person to have a millstone hung around the neck and be thrown into the sea, rather than to cause any of these little ones to stumble. Be careful! If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. If he sins against you seven times in the day, and comes back seven times, saying: ‘I repent!’ you must forgive him.”"
