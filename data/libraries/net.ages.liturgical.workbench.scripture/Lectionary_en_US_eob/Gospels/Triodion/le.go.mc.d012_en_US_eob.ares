lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the chief priests, the presbyters, the scribes, and the whole council held a consultation. Having bound Jesus, they carried him away and delivered him to Pilate. Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “You have said it.” The chief priests began to accuse him of many things, but he answered nothing. Again, Pilate asked him, “Do you have no answer? See how many charges they bring against you!” But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was astonished. Now he used to release to the Jews one prisoner on the occasion of the feast, whichever one they asked of him. There was one called Barabbas, who was then in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the uprising. The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask Pilate to do as he always did for them. Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” For he understood that it was from envy that the chief priests had delivered Jesus. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd so that Pilate would release Barabbas to them instead [of Jesus]. Pilate again asked them, “What then do you want me to do to the one whom you call the King of the Jews?” “Crucify him!” they shouted. Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!” Wishing to please the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them, and after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified."
