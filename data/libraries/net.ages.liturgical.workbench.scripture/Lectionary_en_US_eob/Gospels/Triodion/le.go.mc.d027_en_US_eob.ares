To the one who knocks, it will be opened. Who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a snake? If you then who are evil [still] know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good [things] to those who ask him!”"
