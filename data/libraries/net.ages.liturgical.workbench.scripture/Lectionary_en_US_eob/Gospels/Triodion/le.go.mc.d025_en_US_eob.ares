lemcCO.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Be careful not to make your charitable giving before other people, with the intention to be seen by them. If you do so, you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Therefore, when you do merciful deeds, do not sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets in order to receive glory from men. Amen, I tell you: they have [already] received their reward. But when you do merciful deeds, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your merciful deeds may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly. When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the street corners, in order to be seen by men. Amen, I tell you: they have [already] received their reward! But you, when you pray, enter into your inner room, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret. Then your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. When you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard on account of their many words. Therefore, do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him. Pray like this: ‘Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Your Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we also forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory, now and unto ages of ages. Amen.’ ”"
