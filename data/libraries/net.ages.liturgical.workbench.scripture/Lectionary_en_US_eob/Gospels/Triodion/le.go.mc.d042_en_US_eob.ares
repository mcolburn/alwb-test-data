lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was passing by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And Levi arose and followed Jesus. It then happened that Jesus was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that Jesus was eating with tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?” When Jesus heard it, he replied to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”"
