lemcVE.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “You know that in two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.” Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the presbyters of the people were assembled in the court of the high priest who was called Caiaphas. They were taking counsel together in order to take Jesus by deceit and kill him. But they were saying, “Not during the feast, for fear that the people may cause a riot.” Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came to him with an alabaster jar containing very expensive fragrant oil, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table. But when his disciples saw this, they were upset and said, “Why this waste? This oil could have been sold for a good amount and given to the poor.” However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, “Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good deed for me! You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me. But by pouring this oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. Amen, I tell you: wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told, in memory of her.” Then one of the Twelve who was called Judas Iscariot went to the chief priests and said, “What are you willing to give me in order for me to hand him over to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. From that time on, Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” He replied, “Go into the city to a certain person and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.” ’ ” The disciples did as Jesus instructed them and they prepared the Passover. When evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the Twelve. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come forth from God and was going to God, arose from supper and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel and wrapped it around his waist. After that, he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and wiped them with the towel that was wrapped around him. Then he came to Simon Peter, and [Peter] asked him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” Jesus answered him, “You do not know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.” Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” Jesus told him, “One who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed. Apart from that he is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.” For he knew who was going to betray him, and this is why he said, “You are not all clean.” And so, after washing their feet, he put his outer garment back on, and sat down again. He said to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? You call me, ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord;’ and you say so correctly, for this is what I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash each other’s feet. I have given you an example, so that you too would do as I have done to you. Amen, amen, I tell you: a slave is not greater than his master; neither is the one who is sent greater than he who sent him. Now that you know these things, blessed are you if you do them! As they were eating, he said, “Amen, I tell you that one of you will betray me.” They were extremely distressed, and each one of them began to ask him, “Surely not I, Lord?” He answered, “He who dipped his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me. The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.” Judas, who betrayed him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” And Jesus replied, “You said it.” As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take, eat; this is my body.” Taking the cup, he gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, “Drink [from] it all of you, for this is my blood of the new covenant which is to be poured out for many, for the remission of sins. But I tell you that from now on, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s Kingdom.” After singing [the psalms], they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” But Peter replied, “Even if all [others] will stumble because of you, I never will!” Jesus said to him, “Amen, I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” Peter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And all the disciples said likewise. Then Jesus arrived with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go there and pray.” He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and he began to feel sadness and anguish. Then Jesus said to them, “My soul is extremely sorrowful, even unto death. Stay here, and watch with me.” He went a little forward, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will.” And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. Being in agony, he prayed [even] more intensely, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. When he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, he said to Peter, “Could you not watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak!” Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is not possible to let this cup pass from me unless I drink it, let your will be done.” Again, he came back [to the disciples] and found them asleep because their eyes were heavy. He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words. Then he came to his disciples and told them, “Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners! Arise, let us go! Behold, he who betrays me is near.” While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. And with him came a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and presbyters of the people. Now he who betrayed Jesus gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss is the one. Seize him.” Immediately, he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him. Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came, laid hands on Jesus, and took him away. But behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword. Do you not think that I could ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?” In that hour, Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat every day with you in the temple, teaching, and you did not arrest me [there]. But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled. Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the presbyters were assembled. But Peter followed Jesus from a distance, to the court of the high priest. Having entered in, he sat with the officers to see [what would happen in] the end. Now the chief priests, the presbyters, and the whole council were looking for a false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death, and they found none. Even though many false witnesses were coming forward, they found none [valid]. But at last, two false witnesses came forward, and they said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the sanctuary of God, and to build it in three days.’” The high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Do you not have any answer? What is this that these people testify against you?” But Jesus remained quiet. The high priest told him, “I adjure you by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” Jesus replied, “You have said it! Nevertheless, I tell you that after this, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, coming on the clouds of heaven.” Then the high priest tore his vestments and exclaimed, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. What do you think?” They answered, “He deserves death!” Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him, saying, “Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who hit you?” As Peter was sitting outside in the court, a servant-girl came to him and said, “You too were with Jesus, the Galilean!” But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.” When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.” Again, Peter denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!” After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech reveals that you are [a Galilean].” Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know the man!” Immediately, the rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and wept bitterly. In the morning, all the chief priests and the presbyters of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death; they bound him, led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor."

lemcHW.PassionGospel01.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once. Children, I will be with you [only] a little longer. You will seek me, and now I tell you just as I told the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’ I give you a new commandment: that you love one another! Just as I have loved you, love also one another. This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples: if you have love for one another.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but later you shall follow me.” Peter asked, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!” Jesus answered him, “Will you lay down your life for me? Amen, amen, I tell you; before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!” “Do not let your heart be troubled. Have faith in God! Have faith also in me! In my Father’s house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be there also. You know where I am going, and you know the way.” Thomas asked him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going! And how can we know the way?” Jesus replied to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. And from now on, you know him, and you have seen him.” Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us!” Jesus answered, “I have been with you for such a long time, and still, do you not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father! So how can you say, ‘Show us the Father?’ Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words that I tell you, I do not speak from myself, but the Father who lives in me accomplishes the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me; or else believe me on account of the works themselves. Amen, amen, I tell you; whoever believes in me will also accomplish the works that I accomplish and will do [even] greater works than these, because I am going to my Father. Whatever you will ask in my Name is what I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you will ask anything in my Name, I will accomplish it. If you love me, keep my commandments! I will pray to the Father and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever,the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him and does not know him. But you know him, because he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you orphans! I will come to you! In a short time, the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live! In that day, you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, that person is the one who loves me. Whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love and reveal myself to such a person.” Judas (not Iscariot) asked him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?” Jesus answered him, “The one who loves me will keep my word; my Father will love him and we shall come to him and make a home in him. Whoever does not love me does not keep my words. The word which you hear is not mine, but it belongs to the Father who sent me. I have said these things to you while still living with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit which the Father will send in my Name, will teach you all things and remind you of all that I said to you. Peace I leave with you! My peace I give to you! I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled and do not let it be afraid. You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and I [shall] return to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for my Father is greater than I. Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens, you may believe. I will not speak with you much longer because the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in me. But so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do exactly as the Father has commanded me. Arise, let us be on our way!” “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, so that it may bear more fruit. You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you, unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you [are] the branches! Whoever remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me, you can do nothing. Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown out as a branch and is withered. Such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned! If you remain in me and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire and it will be done for you. In this is my Father glorified: that you bear much fruit; and [this is how] you will be my disciples. Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you! Remain in my love! If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. I have told you these things so that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be complete. This is my commandment: that you love one another, even as I have loved you. No one has a greater love than this: that someone would lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you. I no longer call you bondservants, because the bondservant does not know what his lord is doing. Instead, I have called you friends, because everything that I heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, so that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain. And so, whatever you will ask of the Father in my Name, he will give it to you. These things I command you, so that you may love one another. If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own! But you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, and so the world hates you. Remember what I told you: ‘A bondservant is not greater than his lord.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But they will do all these things to you on account of my Name, because they do not know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin! Whoever hates me also hates my Father. If I had not accomplished among them the works which no one else had done [before], they would not have had sin. But now, they have seen [those things] and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this has happened so that the word which was written in their law may be fulfilled: ‘They hated me without reason.’ But when the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me. You also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.” “I have told you these things, so that you would not be made to stumble. They will expel you from the synagogues! Yes, the time is coming when whoever kills you will think that he is offering service to God! They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me. But I have told you these things, so that when the time arrives, you may remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you. But now, I am going to him who sent me, and none of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’ But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. Yet, I tell you the truth; it is to your advantage that I go away because if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; about sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more; about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. I still have many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth because he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will tell you of things that are yet to come. He will glorify me by taking from what is mine, and he will declare it to you. Everything the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take of [what is] mine and will declare it to you. In a little while, you will not see me, and then after a little while you will see me because I go to the Father.” At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he is saying to us, ‘In a little while, you will no longer see me, and then after a little while you will see me’ and, ‘because I go to the Father?’” And so they kept asking, “What is this that he says, ‘A little while?’ We do not understand what he is saying!” Now Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him [about these things], and he said to them, “Are you discussing among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘In a little while, you will no longer see me, and then after a little while you will see me?’ Amen, amen, I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy! When a woman gives birth, she has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she does not remember the anguish any more because of the joy that a human being is born into the world. Therefore, you now have sorrow, but I will see you again; and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you! In that day you will ask me no [more] questions. Amen, amen, I tell you; whatever you may ask of the Father in my Name, he will give it to you. Until now, you have asked nothing in my Name. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete! I have told you these things in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. In that day, you will ask in my Name. And I do not tell you that I will pray to the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and believed that I came forth from God. I came forth from the Father, and I have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and return to the Father.” His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you speak plainly, not in figures of speech. Now we know that you know all things and we do not need for anyone to ask questions from you. By this we believe that you came forth from God.” Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? Behold, the time is coming, yes, and it has now come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will desert me. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have distress, but rejoice! I have overcome the world.” Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, “Father, the time has come! Glorify your Son, so that your Son may also glorify you, even as you gave him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. This is eternal life: that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent, Jesus Christ. I have glorified you on the earth! I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do! Now, Father, glorify me with yourself with the glory I had with you before the world existed. I have revealed your Name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me; they have kept your word. Now they have known that all things you have given me are from you. The words you have given me, I have given to them. They have received them and they have known for certain that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me. I pray for them; I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. I am no longer in the world, but these are [still] in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your Name which you have given me, so that they may be one, even as we are [one]. While I was with them in the world, I protected them in your Name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled. But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, so that they may have my joy made full in themselves. I have given them your word and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I do not pray that you would take them from the world, but that you would protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in your truth; your word is truth! As you sent me into the world, I too have sent them into the world. I sanctify myself for their sake, so that they too may be sanctified in truth. I do not pray only for these, but also for those who [will] believe in me through their word, so that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you. May they be one in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me. The glory which you have given me, I have given to them, so that they may be one even as we are one; I in them, and you in me. May they be perfected into one, so that the world may know that you sent me, and [that you have] loved them, even as you have loved me. Father, I desire that those whom you have given me would be with me where I am, so that they may see my glory which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world. Righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I knew you; and these have known that you have sent me. I have made your Name known to them, and I will [continue to] make it known; so that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.” After speaking these words, Jesus went out with his disciples over the brook [called] Kidron. A garden was there and he and his disciples entered."

lemcHW.PassionGospel02.text = "At that time, Jesus went out with his disciples over the brook [called] Kidron. A garden was there and he and his disciples entered. Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew about the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples. Judas then, having taken a band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. Jesus, therefore, knowing all that was happening to him, went forward and said to them, “Who are you looking for?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am he.” Judas (who betrayed him), was also standing with them. Now when Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they stepped back and fell to the ground. Again, Jesus asked them, “Who are you looking for?” They replied, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. Therefore, if you are looking for me, let these [my disciples] go their way.” [He said this] so that the word which he had spoken (“Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none”) might be fulfilled. Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. The slave’s name was Malchus. Jesus commanded Peter, “Put the sword into its sheath! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?” At this, the band of soldiers, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews took hold of Jesus and bound him. They first led him to Annas because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year. Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better that one man should perish for the [entire] people. Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did the other disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest and entered in with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard. But Peter was standing at the door outside. So, the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman who guarded the door, and brought Peter in. Then the servant girl who kept the door asked Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?” Peter replied, “I am not!” Now it was cold, and the slaves and officers were standing there, around a charcoal fire they had made. As they were warming themselves, Peter was with them, standing and warming himself. Meanwhile, the high priest asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his teaching. Jesus answered him, “I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret! Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I told them. Behold, these people know what I said.” When Jesus had said this, one of the officers who was standing by slapped him with his hand, saying, “Do you answer the high priest like that?” Jesus replied, “If I have spoken evil, testify to the evil; but if [I have spoken] well, why do you strike me?” Now Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas, the [ruling] high priest. Now while Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, people said to him, “You are not also one of his disciples, are you?” Therefore, he denied it and said, “I am not!” One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did not I see you in the garden with him?” At this, Peter denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed. Then Jesus was taken from Caiaphas to the Praetorium.

But Peter followed Jesus from a distance, to the court of the high priest. Having entered in, he sat with the officers to see [what would happen in] the end. Now the chief priests, the presbyters, and the whole council were looking for a false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death, and they found none. Even though many false witnesses were coming forward, they found none [valid]. But at last, two false witnesses came forward, and they said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the sanctuary of God, and to build it in three days.’ ” The high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Do you not have any answer? What is this that these people testify against you?” But Jesus remained quiet. The high priest told him, “I adjure you by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” Jesus replied, “You have said it! Nevertheless, I tell you that after this, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, coming on the clouds of heaven.” Then the high priest tore his vestments and exclaimed, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. What do you think?” They answered, “He deserves death!” Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him, saying, “Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who hit you?” As Peter was sitting outside in the court, a servant-girl came to him and said, “You too were with Jesus, the Galilean!” But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.” When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him and said to those who were there, “This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.” Again, Peter denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!” After a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your speech reveals that you are [a Galilean].” Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know the man!” Immediately, the rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and wept bitterly."

It was early, and the Jews themselves did not enter into the Praetorium in order not to be made ritually impure and to be able to eat the Passover. For this reason, Pilate went out to them and asked, “What accusation do you bring against this man?” “If he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him over to you.” At this, Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law.” Then the Jews told him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death!” (This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken, by which he had indicated by what kind of death he would die). So Pilate went back into the Praetorium. Having called Jesus, he asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus answered, “Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?” Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?” Jesus replied, “My Kingdom is not of this world! If my Kingdom were of this world, my servants would have fought so that I would not be delivered to the Jews. But as it is, my Kingdom is not from here.” Pilate therefore said to him, “Are you a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. I was born and I have come into the world for this reason: that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is ‘of the truth’ listens to my voice.” Pilate said to him, “What is truth?” After saying this, he went out again to the Jews, and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him. But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Then they all shouted back, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a rebel. Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, placed it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment. They kept saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they kept slapping him. Then Pilate went out again. He said to the Jews, “Behold, I bring him out to you, so that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.” When Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment, Pilate said to them, “Behold, the man!” But when the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify him!” Pilate answered, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.” The Jews insisted, “We have a law, and according to our law, he should die, because he made himself the Son of God.” However, when Pilate heard these words, he was even more afraid. Returning into the Praetorium, he asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. Then Pilate asked him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have the power to crucify you, and the power to release you?” Jesus answered, “You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore, he who delivered me to you has a greater sin.” From then on, Pilate tried to release Jesus, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!” When Pilate heard this word, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement,” and in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.” Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!” But they shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!” And so, Pilate delivered Jesus to them to be crucified."

You see to it.” He threw the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He then went away and hanged himself. The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” They took counsel and bought the potter’s field with the money, [as a place] to bury strangers. Therefore, that field was called “The Field of Blood” even to this day. Thus, what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced, and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me. Now Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “So you say.” But when he was accused by the chief priests and the presbyters, he answered nothing. Pilate then said to him, “Do you not hear how many charges they present against you?” Jesus gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor was astonished. Now on the [occasion of the] feast, the governor had the custom to release one prisoner to the crowd, whoever they desired. At that time, they had a notable prisoner called Barabbas. When they were gathered, Pilate asked them, “Who do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?” For he perceived that it was because of envy that they had arrested him. While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a note to him that said, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man! Today, I have suffered many things in a dream because of him.” Now the chief priests and the presbyters convinced the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus done away with. But the governor asked them, “Which one of the two do you want me to release to you?” They said, “Barabbas!” Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”They all replied, “Let him be crucified!” The governor asked, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they cried out loudly, saying, “Let him be crucified!” And so, when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. You see to it.” All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!” At this, Pilate released Barabbas to them, but had Jesus flogged and delivered to be crucified. Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole garrison against him. They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. They made a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. They knelt down before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” They also spat on him, took the reed and struck him on the head. When they had mocked him, they removed the robe from him, put his [own] clothes on him and led him away to crucify him. As they were coming out, the soldiers found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them and to carry the cross."

Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was then returning from the countryside and passing by. The soldiers compelled him to go with them so that he might carry Jesus’ cross. And they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means, “The place of a skull.” They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it. Then they crucified him and shared his garments among them, casting lots for them to see what each one would take. It was the third hour when they crucified him. The inscription of his accusation was written above him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” With him, they also crucified two rebels; one on his right hand, and one on his left. The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was numbered with transgressors.” Those who passed by blasphemed him, shaking their heads and saying, “So!

But the others said, “Let him be. Let us see whether Elias comes to save him.” Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.

The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised and came out of the tombs after his resurrection. (They entered into the holy city and appeared to many).

We indeed [are punished] justly, because we are receiving the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” He then said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come in your Kingdom.” And Jesus said to him, “Amen, I tell you: today, you will be with me in Paradise.” It was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, because the sun’s light failed.

Then, after Jesus received the sour wine, he said, “It is accomplished!” And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Because it was the Day of Preparation, in order that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate that the legs [of those crucified] might be broken, and that they might be removed. Therefore, the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first who had been crucified with Jesus, then the legs of the other. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately, blood and water came out. He who has seen [this] has borne witness, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, so that you may believe.

When they arrived at the place which is called The Skull, the soldiers crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments among them, the soldiers [began to] cast lots. The people stood by, watching, and with them the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others! Let him save himself, if this is the anointed one, the chosen of God!” The soldiers also mocked him, coming up to him, offering him vinegar, and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, “This is the king of the Jews.” One of the criminals who hanged there began to insult Jesus, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us as well!” But the other spoke up and rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same condemnation? We indeed [are punished] justly, because we are receiving the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” He then said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come in your Kingdom.” And Jesus said to him, “Amen, I tell you: today, you will be with me in Paradise.” It was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, because the sun’s light failed. And the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two. Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last. When the centurion saw what had taken place, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly, this was a righteous man.” And all the multitudes that had come together to this sight, seeing what had happened, returned home beating their breasts. But all those who knew Jesus and the women who had followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things.

lemcH9.Gospel.text = "Αt that time, after the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, to every soldier a part; with the tunic remaining. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. Then they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be!” This was to fulfill the Scripture which says: They have divided my garments among them and for my cloak they cast lots. And this is what the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister (Mary [the wife] of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own home. After this, perceiving that all things were now accomplished, and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” Now a vessel full of sour wine had been placed there; so [the soldiers] filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on [a stick of] hyssop, and held it at his mouth. Then, after Jesus received the sour wine, he said, “It is accomplished!” And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. Because it was the Day of Preparation, in order that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate that the legs [of those crucified] might be broken, and that they might be removed. Therefore, the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first who had been crucified with Jesus, then the legs of the other. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately, blood and water came out. He who has seen [this] has borne witness, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, so that you may believe. For these things happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “Not one of his bones will be broken.” Again, another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they pierced.”"
