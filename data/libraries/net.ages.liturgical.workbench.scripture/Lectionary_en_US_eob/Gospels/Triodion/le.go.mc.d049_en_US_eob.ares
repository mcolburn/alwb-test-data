lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, passing through the region of the Decapolis. And [some] people brought him a person who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged Jesus to lay his hand on him. And taking him aside from the crowd, in private, he put his fingers into the man’s ears, then spat and touched his tongue. Looking up to heaven, Jesus sighed and said to him, “Ephphathá!” that is, “Be opened!” Immediately, the man’s ears were opened; the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. Jesus told the people to tell no one, but the more he ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it. They were amazed beyond words, saying, “Everything he has done is good! He even makes the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”"
