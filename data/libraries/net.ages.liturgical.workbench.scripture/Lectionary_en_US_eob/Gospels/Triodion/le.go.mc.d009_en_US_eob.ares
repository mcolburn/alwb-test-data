lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was approaching Jerusalem and came to Bethsphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go your way into the village that is facing you. Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie him and bring him [to me]. If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him and will send him back right away.’” They went away and found a young donkey tied by a door outside, in the open street. As they untied him, some of the bystanders asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?” The two disciples replied just as Jesus had commanded, and the people let them go. They brought the young donkey to Jesus, threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. Many spread their garments on the way, while others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Those who went in front as well as those who followed cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord! Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming in the Name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest! Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. After looking around at everything, since it was now evening, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve."
