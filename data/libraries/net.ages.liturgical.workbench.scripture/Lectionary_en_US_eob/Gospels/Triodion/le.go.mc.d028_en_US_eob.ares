Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, so that it may bear more fruit. You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you. Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you, unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you [are] the branches! Whoever remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me, you can do nothing. Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown out as a branch and is withered. Such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned! If you remain in me and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire and it will be done for you.”"

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus was going on the Sabbath day through the fields of grain; and his disciples, as they went, began to pluck some heads of grain. The Pharisees asked Jesus, “Behold, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?” Jesus replied, “Have you never read what David and those with him did, when he had need and was hungry? How he entered into the house of God (in the section about Abiathar the high priest) and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful [for anyone] except for the priests to eat. And [how] David also gave it to those who were with him?” Jesus said to them, “The Sabbath was made for humankind, not humankind for the Sabbath! Therefore, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.” Again, Jesus entered into the synagogue, and there was a man who had a withered hand. The Pharisees were watching Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day, so that they might accuse him. Jesus said to the man who had his hand withered, “Stand up!” He then said to those who were watching, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day, or [is it lawful] to do harm? Is it lawful to save a life or to kill?” But they remained silent. After looking around at them with anger and being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, Jesus said to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” The man stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other."
