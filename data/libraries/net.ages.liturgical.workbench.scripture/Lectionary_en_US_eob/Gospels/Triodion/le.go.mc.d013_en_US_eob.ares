lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the soldiers, after mocking Jesus, stripped him of the purple [cloak] and put his own garments on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. And they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means, “The place of a skull.” It was the third hour when they crucified him. When the sixth hour came, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Some of those who stood by, when they heard this, exclaimed, “Behold, he is calling Elias!” One [of them] ran to fill a sponge with vinegar. He put it on a reed and gave it to Jesus to drink. Then he said, “Let us leave him alone and see if Elias will come to take him down.” But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and gave up the spirit. The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from the top to the bottom. When the centurion who stood there in front of Jesus saw that he had cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was [the] Son of God!” There were also women watching from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James ‘the little’ and of Joses, and Salome. When Jesus was in Galilee, they had followed him and served him; along with many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem."
