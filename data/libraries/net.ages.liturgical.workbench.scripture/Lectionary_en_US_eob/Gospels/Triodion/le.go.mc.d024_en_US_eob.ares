lemcCO.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Watch out that you do not get led astray, for many will come in my Name, saying: ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is at hand!’ Do not follow them! When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not come right away.” Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be fearful events and great signs from heaven. But before all these things [happen], you will be placed under arrest and be persecuted; you will be handed over to synagogues and prisons, and brought before kings and governors for my Name’s sake. But it will turn out for you as an occasion to bear witness. Therefore, settle it in your hearts not to ponder in advance how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or withstand. You will be handed over even by parents, relatives, friends, and brothers. Some of you will be put to death. You will be hated by all for my Name’s sake, yet not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance acquire your lives. But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains! Let those who are in the midst of her depart! Let those who are in the countryside not enter in [the city]. For these are days of vengeance, so that all things which are written may be fulfilled. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and will be taken away as captives into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth, the anxiety of nations, perplexed [over] the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear, apprehensive of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near.” Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they are already budding, you see it and know on your own that the summer is already near. Likewise, when you see these things happening, understand that the Kingdom of God is near. Amen, I tell you: this generation will not pass away until all [these] things are accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. And so, be on guard, for fear that your hearts may be weighed down with entertaining distractions, overdrinking, and the worries of this life, and that day will come upon you unexpectedly. For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. Therefore, be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”"
