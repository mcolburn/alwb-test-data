lemcVE.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him in private, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” Jesus answered them, “Be careful not to be led astray! For many will come in my Name, saying: ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many people astray. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Do not be troubled; all of this must take place, but the end is not yet. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are [only] the beginning of the birth pains. Then they will deliver you up to oppression and they will kill you. You will be hated by all the nations for my Name’s sake. Many will stumble and will betray and hate each other. Many false prophets will arise and they will lead many astray. Because wickedness will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. Therefore, when you see the “abomination of desolation” which was spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. The one who is on the housetop should not [even] go down to carry out the things that are in the house. The one who is in the field should not [even] return to get his clothes. But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days! Pray that your flight will not be in the winter or a Sabbath day. For then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, and such as will never be again. Unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened. Then if any one tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There,’ do not believe it! False messiahs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders in order to lead many astray, and if possible, even the elect. Behold, I have told you this in advance. If therefore people tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it! For as the lightning flashes from the east and is seen even to the west, this is how the coming of the Son of Man will be. For wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together. But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, the powers of the heavens will be shaken; and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other. Now learn this parable from the fig tree. When its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near. Likewise, when you see all these things, know that the time is near, even at the doors. Amen, I tell you that this generation will not pass away until all these things are accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."

lemcMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees went off and took counsel on how they might ensnare Jesus in his talk. They sent their own disciples to Jesus, along with the Herodians, and asked, “Teacher, we know that you are honest and that you teach the way of God in truth. You are not swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are. Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites? Show me the tax money.” They brought him a denarius. Jesus asked them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” They answered, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” When they heard this [reply], they were amazed, and leaving him, they went away. On that [same] day, Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him [a question], saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother shall marry his wife and have a posterity for his brother.’ Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no descendant he left his wife to his brother. In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh. After them all, the woman also died. In the resurrection therefore, which one of the seven brothers will have her as wife, for they all had her as wife?” But Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God. For in the resurrection, people neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like the angels of God in heaven. However, concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying: ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’ God is not the God of the dead, but of the living!” When the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together. One of them, a lawyer, then asked him a question in order to test him. “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment. The second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ The entire law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.” Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question, saying, “What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They answered, “[He is the son] of David.” Jesus said to them, “How, then, does David, in the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?’ If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?” No one was able to answer him a word, and from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions. Jesus then spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. Therefore, whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but do not imitate their works; for they preach and [yet] do not act accordingly. Indeed, they bind heavy burdens that are dreadful to bear and put them on people’s shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them. Instead, they do all their works to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, they enlarge the fringes of their garments, and love the place of honor at feasts. They love the best seats in the synagogues, the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by people. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers. Call no man on the earth ‘your father,’ for one is your Father, he who is in heaven. And do not be called ‘teacher,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ. Instead, the one who is the greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore, you will receive a greater condemnation. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut the Kingdom of Heaven in the face of people and you yourselves do not enter! And those who would enter, you prevent from doing so. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one convert; and when one is converted, you make him twice as much of an heir of Gehenna as yourselves. Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, ‘If someone swears by the sanctuary, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound.’ You blind fools! Which is greater, the gold, or the sanctuary that sanctifies the gold? You say, ‘If someone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if someone swears by the gift that is placed on it, he is bound!’ You fools and blind [men]! Which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Therefore, whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. Whoever swears by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who dwelt in it. Whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have not fulfilled the truly significant matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. It is these you should have practiced, without neglecting the others. You are blind guides who filter out a fly and yet swallow a camel! Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but inside, they are full of greed and unrighteousness. You blind Pharisees, first clean the inside of the cup and platter, so that the outside may also become clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside, they are full of dead bones and all [kinds of] impurity. Likewise, you also appear righteous to men outwardly, but inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous, saying, ‘If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have partaken with them in the blood of the prophets.’ Therefore, you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets! Fill up, then, the measure [of sin] of your forefathers. You serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna ? Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city. Thus all the righteous blood shed on the earth will come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar. Amen, I tell you: all these things will come upon this generation. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often have I desired to gather your children, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings; but you were not willing! Behold, your house is left to you in a desolate state. For I tell you, you will not see me from now on until [the day when] you are saying, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord!’ ”"
