lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a man came to Jesus, and said: “Teacher, I brought you my son who has a mute spirit. Wherever [the spirit] seizes him, it throws him to the ground and my son foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able.” Jesus answered him, “Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to me.” They brought the son to him, and when he saw Jesus, the spirit immediately convulsed the boy who fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has he been like this?” “From childhood,” he answered. “Often, it has thrown him both into the fire and into water, in order to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us!” Jesus said to the man, “If you are able! All things are possible to the one who believes!” Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe! Help my unbelief!” When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!” The spirit cried out, convulsed greatly, and came out of the boy. He became as dead, so much that many said, “He is dead!” But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up; and the boy stood up. When Jesus entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” He answered, “This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.” They left that place and passed through Galilee, [and] Jesus did not want anyone to know it. He was teaching his disciples and told them, “The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and when he is killed, he will rise again on the third day.”"
