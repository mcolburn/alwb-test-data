lemcMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was approaching Jerusalem and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples [ahead of the group]. He told them, “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately, he will let them go.” All this was done so that what had been spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled: Tell the daughter of Zion, behold, your King comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. The disciples went and did exactly what Jesus had instructed them. They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on them. A very great crowd spread their clothes on the road while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Many people went before him and those who followed kept shouting, “Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” When he had come into Jerusalem, the entire city was stirred up and people were saying, “Who is this?” And the multitude answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee!” But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he was doing and that children were shouting in the temple and saying “Hosanna to the son of David!,” they were very displeased. They asked him, “Do you hear what these [children] are saying?” Jesus replied, “Yes! Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise?’” He left them, went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there."

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus (who had been dead and whom Jesus had raised from the dead) lived. Therefore, they gave a supper for him there. Martha served while Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him. Then Mary took a pound of fragrance of pure nard, very precious; she anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, one of his disciples and the one who would betray him, said, “Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” Now Judas said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into it. But Jesus said, “Leave her alone! She has kept this for the day of my burial. For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.” Meanwhile, a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there. They came, not only for Jesus’ sake, but also in order to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead. The chief priests even conspired to put Lazarus to death as well, because on his account many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believed in him. On the next day, a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they took branches from palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord, the King of Israel!” Having found a young donkey, Jesus sat on it. As it is written: “Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion! Behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt.” His disciples did not understand these things at first, but after Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him. Now the multitude that had been with Jesus when he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify about it. For this reason also, the crowd had come out to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign."
