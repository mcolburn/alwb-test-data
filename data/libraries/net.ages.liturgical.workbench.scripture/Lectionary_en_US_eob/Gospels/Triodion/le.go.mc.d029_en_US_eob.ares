Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, “We have found the one of whom Moses in the law and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph!” Nathanael asked him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see!” As Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, he said about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael asked Jesus, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!” Jesus said to him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” He said to Philip, “Amen, amen, I tell you; hereafter, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”"
