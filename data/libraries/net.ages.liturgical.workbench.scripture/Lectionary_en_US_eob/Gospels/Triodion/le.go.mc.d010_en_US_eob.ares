lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve, went off to [meet] the chief priests, in order to deliver Jesus to them. When they heard this, they were glad, and promised to give him money. Judas began to seek how he might conveniently deliver him. On the first day of unleavened bread, when the Jews sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations so that you may eat the Passover?” He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him, and wherever he enters, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ He himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.” His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover. When it was evening, Jesus came with the Twelve. As they sat and were eating, Jesus said, “Amen, I tell you: one of you will betray me; the one who eats with me.” And they began to be distressed, and they asked him, one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?” He answered them, “It is one of the Twelve, the one who dips with me in the dish. The Son of Man goes just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man not to have been born.” As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after saying a blessing, he broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “Take, eat. This is my body.” He took the cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said to them, “This is my blood of the new covenant, which is to be poured out for many. Amen, I tell you: I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God.” After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to them, “All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.” But Peter said to him, “Even if all fall away, I will not!” Jesus said to him, “Amen, I tell you that today, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you yourself will deny me three times!” But Peter insisted, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you!” And they all said the same thing. They arrived at a place which was named Gethsemane. Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.” He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. He said to them, “My soul is extremely sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and keep watch.” He went ahead a little, fell on the ground on his face , and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.” Coming back, he found the disciples sleeping, and said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak!” Again, he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. And when he came back, he found them asleep again, because their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. The third time, he came and said to them, “Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough! The hour has come! Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Arise, let us be on our way, for behold, the one who betrays me is near.”"
