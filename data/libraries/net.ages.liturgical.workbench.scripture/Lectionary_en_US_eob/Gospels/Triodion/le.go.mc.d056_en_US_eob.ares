lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went out with his disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” They answered, “John the Baptizer, and others say Elias, but others yet [say that you are] one of the prophets.” Jesus said to them, “But you, who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered, “You are the Christ!” Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the presbyters, the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
