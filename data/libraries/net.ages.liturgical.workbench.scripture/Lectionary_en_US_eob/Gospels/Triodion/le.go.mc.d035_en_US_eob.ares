lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went out into a deserted place and prayed there. Simon and those with him followed Jesus. When they found him, they told him, “Everyone is looking for you!” He replied, “Let us go into the next towns, so that I may preach there also, for this is why I came.” And he was preaching in their synagogues throughout all of Galilee, casting out demons. A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down before him, and saying, “If you want to, you can make me clean!” Being moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand, touched the man, and said to him, “I want to! Be made clean.” When Jesus said this, the leprosy immediately departed from the leper and he was made clean. Jesus strictly warned him, and sent him out at once, saying, “See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest. Offer for your cleansing what Moses instructed, as a testimony to them.”"
