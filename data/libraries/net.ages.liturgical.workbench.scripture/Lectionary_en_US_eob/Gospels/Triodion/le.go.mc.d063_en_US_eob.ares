lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. It was that [same] Mary who had anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair and whose brother, Lazarus, was sick. So the sisters sent [word] to Jesus, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick!” But when Jesus heard it, he said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.” Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. Yet, when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed two [more] days in the place where he was. After this, he said to the disciples, “Let us go into Judea again.” The disciples told him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and you are going there again?” Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the day does not stumble because he sees the light of this world. But anyone who walks in the night will stumble because the light is not in him.” He said these things, and then added, “Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.” At this, his disciples said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep. And so, Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” Then Thomas (who is called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go also, so that we may die with him.” And so, when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already. Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away. Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. Then, when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house. Therefore, Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died! But even now, I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.” Jesus replied, “Your brother will rise again.” Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life! The one who believes in me, even though he dies, will live! Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” She answered, “Yes, Lord! I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who comes into the world.” When she had said this, she went away, and called her sister Mary in private, saying, “The Teacher is here, and [he] is calling you.” When Mary heard this, she arose quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha had met him. Then the Jews who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw that she got up quickly and went out. They followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.” Therefore, when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died!” When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her [also] weeping, he groaned in the spirit and was deeply moved. He asked, “Where have you laid him?” They told him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus wept. At this, the Jews said, “See how much affection he had for Lazarus!” Some of them said, “Could not the one who opened the eyes of the man who was blind have also kept Lazarus from dying?” Jesus therefore, being again deeply moved, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was placed against it. Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days!” Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see God’s glory?” And so, they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, “Father, I thank you that you have listened to me. I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around, I said this, so that they may believe that you sent me.” After saying this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” Then he who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.” As a result, many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus had accomplished believed in him."
