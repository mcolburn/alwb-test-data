lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the whole assembly of the chief priests, scribes and presbyters of the people brought Jesus before Pilate, and they began to bring charges against him, saying, “We have found this man perverting the nation, forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” So Pilate questioned him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “You say it.” Pilate said to the chief priests and to the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”Still, they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee [and] even to this place.” But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. When he found out that Jesus was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was extremely glad because he had desired to see him for a long time as he had heard many things about him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him. He questioned Jesus with many words, but Jesus gave no reply. [Meanwhile], the scribes and the chief priests stood by, vehemently accusing him. Then Herod and his soldiers humiliated and mocked Jesus. Dressing him in a luxurious robe, they sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, [although] before this, they had been enemies.Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people. He said to them, “You brought this man to me as someone who perverts the people, and behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for I sent you back to him . As you can see, this man has done nothing worthy of death! Therefore, I will punish him and [then] release him.” Now Pilate had to release one prisoner to them at the feast. But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”This one had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion in the city, and for murder. Then Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus. But they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” For the third time, Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found nothing worthy of death in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” But they were insistent with loud voices, demanding that Jesus be crucified. And their shouts and the shouts of the chief priests prevailed. So Pilate decreed that what they were asking for should be done. He released Barabbas, who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, as the people had requested. But Jesus he delivered up to their will. As the soldiers were leading Jesus away, they seized Simon, a Cyrenian [who was] coming from the countryside. They laid the cross on him, to carry it after Jesus. A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. But Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me! Instead, weep for yourselves and for your children! For behold, the days are coming in which people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ Then people will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’ For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will be done when it is dry?” When they arrived at the place which is called The Skull, the soldiers crucified him there. It was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, because the sun’s light failed. And the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two. Crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last. When the centurion saw what had taken place, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly, this was a righteous man.” And all the multitudes that had come together to this sight, seeing what had happened, returned home beating their breasts. But all those who knew Jesus and the women who had followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things. And behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man (who had not consented to their counsel and deed). He was from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, and he was also waiting for the Kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. He took it down, wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. It was the [day of the] Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. And the women who had come with Jesus out of Galilee followed [ Joseph] and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid. They returned [home], and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath, they rested according to the commandment."
