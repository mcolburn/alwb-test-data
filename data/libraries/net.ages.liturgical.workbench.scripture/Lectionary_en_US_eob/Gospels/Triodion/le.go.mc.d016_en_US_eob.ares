lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus approached Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, saying, “Go your way into the village on the other side. There, as you enter, you will find a colt tied up, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it, and bring it. If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ reply, ‘The Lord needs it!’” Those who were sent went away and found the colt standing just as Jesus had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?” They replied, “The Lord needs it!” They brought it to Jesus, and having thrown their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on [it]. As he went, they [also] spread their cloaks in the way. As Jesus was now approaching, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the deeds of power which they had seen. [They were] saying, “Blessed is he who is coming, a King in the Name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!” And from the multitude, some of the Pharisees said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!” But he answered them, “I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out!” Then the day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat [the Passover meal].” They asked him, “Where do you want us to make preparations?” Jesus replied, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. Then tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.” They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and made preparations for the Passover. When the hour had come, he sat down with the Twelve apostles. He said to them, “With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, for I tell you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.” Then, taking a cup and having given thanks, he said, “Take this, and share it among you, for I tell you, I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine until the Kingdom of God comes.” And having taken bread and given thanks, he broke it and gave [it] to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.” Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is to be poured out for you. But behold, the hand of the one who betrays me is with me at the table. And the Son of Man indeed is going, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!” Then they began to discuss among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing. An argument also arose between them about which one of them was considered to be the greatest. Jesus said to them, “The kings of the nations have lordship over the people, and those who have authority over people are called ‘benefactors.’ But not so with you! Instead, the one who is the greater among you should become as the younger, and the one who is leading as the one who serves. Indeed, who is greater, the one reclining at the table, or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? Yet, I am among you as one who serves. But you are those who have remained with me in my trials, and now I bestow a kingdom upon you, just as my Father bestowed [a kingdom] upon me, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom; and you will sit on thrones, judging the Twelve tribes of Israel.” And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you, so that he might sift you [all] like wheat! But I have prayed for you, that your faith would not fail. And you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brethren.” But Simon said, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!” At this Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me!” Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They replied, “Nothing.” He then said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse should take it, and likewise a bag! Whoever has no sword should sell his cloak and buy one! For I tell you that what is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’ Indeed, the things [written] concerning me are [reaching] a completion.” So the disciples exclaimed, “Lord, behold, here are two swords!” but he told them, “That is enough!” Jesus came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him."
