lemcVE.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “No one knows that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but only my Father. As in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Just as in the days which were before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark. They did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so also will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left; two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and one will be left! Therefore, watch, because you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming. However, know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, be ready, for it is at an hour which you do not expect that the Son of Man will come. Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food in due season? Blessed is that slave whom his lord finds doing so when he comes. Amen, I tell you that he will set him over all that he has. But if that evil slave should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his return,’ and if he should begin to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with the drunkards, the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not expect it and in an hour when he does not know, and he will cut him into pieces and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. And there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” “Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise, and five were foolish. Those who were foolish took their lamps but brought no oil along with them, whereas the wise ones brought oil in their vessels along with their lamps. Now since the bridegroom was late, they all became tired and fell asleep. But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’ Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. The foolish virgins said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.’ But the wise virgins answered: ‘What if there is not enough for us and you? But go rather to those who sell [oil] and buy some for yourselves.’ While they went away to buy [oil], the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and then the door was shut. Afterwards, the other virgins also arrived and said: ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ But he answered, ‘Amen, I tell you that I do not know you!’ Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour that the Son of Man is coming. Indeed, the Kingdom is like a man who was leaving for another country. He called his own slaves and entrusted his goods to them. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. And immediately he went on a journey. Then the one who received five talents went off, did business with them and earned another five talents. And in the same way, the one who had received two gained another two. But the slave who received one talent went off, dug [a hole] in the ground and hid his lord’s money. After a long time, the lord of those slaves returned and settled accounts with them. The one who had received the five talents came forward and brought another five talents, saying: ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five!’ The lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord!’ The one who had received the two talents also came forward and said, ‘Lord, you entrusted me with two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents!’ The lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord!’ The one who had received one talent now came forward and said, ‘Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter. I was afraid! I went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours!’ But his lord answered, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You understood that I reap where I did not sow, and that I gather where I did not scatter. And so, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming, I would have received it back with interest. Therefore, take away the talent from this one, and give it to the one who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has, [more] will be given and he will have in abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. Throw out the unprofitable slave into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’” “But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of my Father! Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world! For I was hungry and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; I was a stranger and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you; or thirsty and give you a drink? When did we see you as a stranger and take you in; or naked, and clothe you? When did we see you sick, or in prison, and visit you?’ The King will answer them, ‘Amen, I tell you: as much as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.’ Then he will also say to those on his left hand, ‘Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels! For I was hungry and you gave me no food; I was thirsty and you gave me no drink; I was a stranger and you did not receive me; naked, and you did not clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit me.’ Then they will answer him: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?’ Then he will answer them, saying: ‘Amen, I tell you: as much as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ These [ones on the left] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to his disciples, “You know that in two days the Passoveris coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.”"

lemcMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, the multitude that had been with Jesus when he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify about it. For this reason also, the crowd had come out to meet him, because they had heard that he had done this sign. The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, “See how this is accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him!” Now among those that went up to express adoration at the feast were some Greeks. They came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and asked him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew and Philip told Jesus. But Jesus answered them, saying, “The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified! Amen, amen, I tell you; unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself a single seed. But if it dies, it bears much fruit! Whoever loves his life will lose it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life. Anyone who serves me must follow me! Where I am, there will my servant also be. The Father will honor anyone who serves me. Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this time?’ But I have come to this time for this reason. Father, glorify your Name!” Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.” At this, the multitude who stood by heard it, and they said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes. Now judgment is upon this world! Now the ruler of this world will be cast out! And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all [people] to myself.” But he said this to indicate by what kind of death he should die. The multitude answered him, “We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’ Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus therefore said to them, “The light is with you a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you. Whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he left and hid from them. Still, even though he had performed so many signs in front of them, they did not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaias the prophet: Lord, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? For this reason, they could not believe, for Isaias said elsewhere: He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them. Isaias said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him. However, even many among the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess it [openly], so that they would not be put out of the synagogue, for they loved human praise more than God’s praise. Jesus cried aloud, “Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in the one who sent me! Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me. I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the dark. If anyone listens to my sayings and does not believe, I do not judge this person. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world! Whoever rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge [already]: the word that I spoke is what will judge such a person in the last day. Indeed, I did not speak from myself; instead, the Father who sent me has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. I know that his commandment is eternal life. And therefore what the Father has told me is what I speak.”"
