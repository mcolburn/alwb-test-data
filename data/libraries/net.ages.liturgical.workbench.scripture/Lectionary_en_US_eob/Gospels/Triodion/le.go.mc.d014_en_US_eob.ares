lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Watch out that you do not get led astray, for many will come in my Name, saying: ‘I am he ,’ and, ‘The time is at hand!’ Do not follow them! When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not come right away. There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth, the anxiety of nations, perplexed [over] the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will faint from fear, apprehensive of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. And so, be on guard, for fear that your hearts may be weighed down with entertaining distractions, overdrinking, and the worries of this life, and that day will come upon you unexpectedly. For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. Therefore, be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”"
