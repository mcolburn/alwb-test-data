lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, while Jesus was still speaking to the disciples, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him came a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the presbyters. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him and take him away under guard.” So when he came, he immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Hail Rabbi!” and kissed him. They laid their hands on Jesus and arrested him. But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. Jesus said, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I was with you in the temple, teaching, and you did not arrest me! But this is [taking place] so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.” All his disciples left him and fled. A certain young man was following Jesus, wearing only a linen cloth [as a tunic]. The young men grabbed him, but he left the linen cloth [behind], and fled from them naked. They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the presbyters and the scribes were assembled with him. Peter had followed Jesus from a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, warming himself in the light of the fire. Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for witnesses [to testify] against Jesus in order to put him to death. But they could not find any. Many gave false testimonies against him, and their testimonies did not agree with each other. Some stood up, and bore false witness against Jesus, saying: “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this sanctuary that is made with hands, and in three days, I will build another made without hands.’” Even so, their testimony did not agree. The high priest stood up in their midst and asked Jesus, “Do you have no answer? What is this which these testify against you?” But Jesus remained silent and answered nothing. Again, the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?” Jesus replied, “I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.” At this, the high priest tore his robes and said, “What further need do we have for witnesses? You have surely heard the blasphemy! What is your decision?” And they all condemned him as deserving death. Some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to beat him with fists, saying, “Prophesy to us! Who hit you?” And the officers struck him with the palms of their hands. As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maidservants of the high priest came in. Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with Jesus the Nazarene!” But he denied it, saying, “I do not know or understand what you are talking about!” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed. When the servant girl saw him again, she began to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them!” But again, he denied it. A little while later, those who stood by again said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them! You are a Galilean, and your accent shows it.” But Peter began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak!” The rooster crowed the second time, and Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he broke down and wept. As soon as it was the morning, the chief priests, the presbyters, the scribes, and the whole council held a consultation. Having bound Jesus, they carried him away and delivered him to Pilate."
