lemcMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was returning to the city, he was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it, “Let there be no fruit from you, unto the ages!” Immediately the fig tree withered away! When the disciples saw it, they marveled and asked, “How did the fig tree wither away at once?” Jesus answered them, “Amen, I tell you that if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done! Whatever things you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive them all!” When he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the presbyters of the people came to him as he was teaching. They asked, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?” Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you one question and if you answer me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?” They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd because everyone considers John as a prophet.” So they answered Jesus: “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.” “But what do you think? A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’ The son answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he was sorry and went. The father came to his second son, and said the same thing. The son answered, ‘I will go, sir,’ but he did not go. Which one of the two sons did the will of his father?” They replied, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Amen, I tell you that tax collectors and prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you! For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. After seeing this, you did not even repent and you did not believe him. Hear another parable. There was a man who was the owner of a household. He planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, and leased it out to farmers. He then left for another country. When the season for the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the farmers, to receive his fruit. But the farmers took his slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned yet another. Again, the owner sent other slaves, even more than the first time; and they treated them in the same way. Then he sent his son to them, saying: ‘They will respect my son!’ But the farmers, when they saw the son, said to each other, ‘This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’ And so they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard returns, what will he do with those farmers?” They answered him, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and he will lease out the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in its season.” Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The [very] stone which the builders rejected was made the head of the corner. This was from the Lord and it is marvelous in our eyes?’ Therefore, I tell you that the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and it will be given to a people bringing forth its fruit."
