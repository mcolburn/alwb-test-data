lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. Having arrived at the place, he said to them, “Pray that you do not enter into temptation!” He then withdrew from them about a stone’s throw [away], knelt down and prayed, saying, “Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of sheer grief. He said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation!” While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude [came], and the one who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. This is the sign he had given them, saying, “Whoever I will kiss is the one.” but Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?” When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” And one of them struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. But Jesus said, “Let me at least do this” —and he touched the servant’s ear, and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and presbyters who had come against him, “Have you come out as against someone leading a rebellion, with swords and clubs? When I was with you in the temple every day, you did not stretch out your hands against me! But this is your hour, and the power of the darkness.” They arrested him and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance. When people had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter also sat among them. A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, she exclaimed, “This man also was with him!” However, Peter denied [him], saying, “Woman, I do not know him!” A little while later, someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter answered, “Sir, I am not!” After about one hour had passed, another insisted, saying, “Truly, this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” But Peter said, “Sir, I do not know what you are talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. Then the Lord turned, and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” So Peter went out and wept bitterly. Now the men who held Jesus [in custody] were mocking him and beating him. Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” They said many other insulting things to him. As soon as it was day, the assembly of the presbyters of the people was gathered, both chief priests and scribes. They brought Jesus into their council, saying: “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But Jesus said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I also question [you], you will not answer me or release me. From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the Power of God.” They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say it, for I am.” Then they exclaimed, “Why do we need any more witnesses? We ourselves have heard [it] from his own mouth!” Their whole group arose and brought Jesus before Pilate."
