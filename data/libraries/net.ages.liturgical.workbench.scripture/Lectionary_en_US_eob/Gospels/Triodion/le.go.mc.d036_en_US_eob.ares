lemcLI.Gospel.text = "Αt that time, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and it was heard that he was in the house. Immediately, many people gathered so that there was no more room, not even around the door. As Jesus was preaching the word to them, four men came, carrying a paralytic to him. Since they could not come near Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat which the paralytic was lying on. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins have been forgiven you.” But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and they reasoned in their hearts, “Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins except God alone?” Immediately, Jesus perceived in his spirit that they were reasoning within themselves in this way. He asked them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Arise, take up your bed, and walk?’ But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralytic—“I tell you, arise and take up your mat, and go to your house!” At once, the man arose and took up the mat, and went out in front of everyone. The people were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”"
