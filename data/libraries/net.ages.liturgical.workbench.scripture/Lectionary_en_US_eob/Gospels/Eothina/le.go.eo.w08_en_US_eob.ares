leeoMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, Mary remained standing outside the tomb, weeping. As she was crying, she stooped to look inside the tomb, and saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head, and one at the feet. They asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She answered, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” Now after saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she answered, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned around and said to him, “Rabbouni!” (which is to say, “Teacher!”) Jesus said to her, “Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her."
