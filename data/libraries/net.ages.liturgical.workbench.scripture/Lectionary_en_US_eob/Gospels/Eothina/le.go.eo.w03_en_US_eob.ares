leeoMA.Gospel.text = "Now after Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told [this to] those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. When they heard that Jesus was alive and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. After these things, he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country. They went on their way and told it to the rest who did not believe them, either. Afterward, Jesus was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen. He said to them, “Go into the whole world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; but whoever disbelieves will be condemned. These signs will accompany those who believe: they will cast out demons in my Name; they will speak with new languages; they will take up snakes; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.” And so, the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that accompanied them. Amen."
