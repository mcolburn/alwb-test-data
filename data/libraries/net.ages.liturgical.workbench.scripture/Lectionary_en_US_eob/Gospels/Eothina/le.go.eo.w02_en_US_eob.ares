leeoMA.Gospel.text = "When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices in order to come and anoint him. Very early on the first day of the week, they arrived at the tomb when the sun had risen. They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?” But when they looked up, they saw that the stone was [already] rolled back, although it was extremely large. Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. He said to them, “Do not be amazed! You seek Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen! He is not here! Behold, the place where they laid him! But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he told you.’” They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid."
