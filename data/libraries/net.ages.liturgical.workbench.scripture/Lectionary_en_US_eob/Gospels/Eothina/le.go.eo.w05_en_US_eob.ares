leeoMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves. He returned to his home, wondering what had taken place. It then happened that two of the disciples were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about all of these things which had taken place. And as they were talking together and discussing this, Jesus himself came near and went along with them. However, their eyes were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, “What are you talking about as you walk?” And they stopped walking, looking sad. One of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know what has happened there in these days?” “What things?” he asked to them. They replied, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene! He was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and had him crucified. But we were hoping that he was the one who would redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things have taken place. Also, certain women of our company have puzzled us: having arrived early at the tomb, they did not find his body. And they came back saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive! Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.” He said to them, “You foolish men! So slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. As they were approaching the village where they were going, he acted like he would continue on his way. “Stay with us!” they urged him, saying, “It is almost evening, and the day is almost over!” So he went in to stay with them. Now it happened that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them. And their eyes were opened; they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. Then they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and [also] those who were with them. They were saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” Then the two related what had happened along the way, and how they had recognized him in the breaking of the bread."
