Jesus came to them and said, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go [therefore] and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all the things that I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen!"
