lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “A man who was leaving for another country called his own slaves and entrusted his goods to them. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. And immediately he went on a journey. Then the one who received five talents went off, did business with them and earned another five talents. And in the same way, the one who had received two gained another two. But the slave who received one talent went off, dug [a hole] in the ground and hid his lord’s money. After a long time, the lord of those slaves returned and settled accounts with them. The one who had received the five talents came forward and brought another five talents, saying: ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five!’ The lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord!’ The one who had received the two talents also came forward and said, ‘Lord, you entrusted me with two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents!’ The lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord!’ The one who had received one talent now came forward and said, ‘Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter. I was afraid! I went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours!’ But his lord answered, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You understood that I reap where I did not sow, and that I gather where I did not scatter. And so, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming, I would have received it back with interest. Therefore, take away the talent from this one, and give it to the one who has the ten talents. For to everyone who has, [more] will be given and he will have in abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. Throw out the unprofitable slave into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’” Sayings these things, he cried out, “Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
