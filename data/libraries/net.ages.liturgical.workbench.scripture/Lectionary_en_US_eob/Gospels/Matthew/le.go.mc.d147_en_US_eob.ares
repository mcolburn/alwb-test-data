lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. He touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and served him. When evening came, many who were possessed with demons were brought to him. He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. Thus, what had been spoken through Isaias the prophet was fulfilled: ‘He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.’ Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side. A scribe came and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go!” Jesus replied, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” Another of his disciples said to Jesus, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.” But Jesus replied, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their [own] dead.” When he got into the boat, his disciples followed him."
