Whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. Indeed, what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world and loses his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life? For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to their deeds. Amen, I tell you: some are standing here who will not have tasted death until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”"
