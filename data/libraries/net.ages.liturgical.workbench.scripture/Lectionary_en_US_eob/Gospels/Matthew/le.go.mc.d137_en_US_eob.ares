But beware of men: they will hand you over to councils and in their synagogues, they will flog you. Yes, you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as witnesses to them and to the nations. When they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say; what you are to say will be given you in that hour. Indeed, it is not you who [shall] speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. Brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death. You will be hated by all for my Name’s sake, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.”"
