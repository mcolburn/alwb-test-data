lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus when he was alone, and together with the Twelve asked him about the parable of the sower. Jesus told them, “The mysteries of the Kingdom of God are given for you to know, but to those who are outside, everything comes in parables, so that ‘seeing they may [indeed] see, and [yet] not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and [yet] not understand; otherwise they might repent and their sins be forgiven.’ ” Jesus asked them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the [other] parables? The farmer sows the word. Some people are like the seed sown by the edge of the road where the word is sown. As soon as they have heard, Satan comes and takes away the word which had been sown in their hearts. Likewise, those who are sown on the rocky places are those who receive the word with joy as soon as they hear it. But they have no root in themselves and only last for a short while. When oppression or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately stumble. These are the ones who are sown among the thorns: the people who hear the word, but the worries of this age, the deceit of wealth, and the desire to possess things enter in and choke the word. Thus, it produces no fruit. The seeds which were sown on the good ground are these who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit. Some multiply thirty times, some sixty, and some a hundred times!” Jesus said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be placed under a basket or under a bed? Is it not placed on a stand? For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed, and nothing was made secret that should not come to light. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
