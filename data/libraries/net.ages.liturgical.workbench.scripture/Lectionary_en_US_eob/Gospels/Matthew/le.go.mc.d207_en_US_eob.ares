lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus returned [to his] home and again, the crowd assembled, so much that they could not even eat bread. When his own [friends] heard it, they came to take charge of him, saying, “He is insane!” The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “He is casting out demons by the [authority of the] prince of the demons!” Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has [come to] an end. No one can enter into the house of a strong man in order to plunder it, unless he first binds the strong man. Then he will plunder his house.”"
