They asked, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?” Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you one question and if you answer me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?” They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd because everyone considers John as a prophet.” So they answered Jesus: “We do not know.” He also said to them, “Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”"
