lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous, saying, ‘If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have partaken with them in the blood of the prophets.’ Therefore, you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets! Fill up, then, the measure [of sin] of your forefathers. You serpents, offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna ? Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city. Thus all the righteous blood shed on the earth will come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar. Amen, I tell you: all these things will come upon this generation. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often have I desired to gather your children, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings; but you were not willing! Behold, your house is left to you in a desolate state. For I tell you, you will not see me from now on until [the day when] you are saying, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord!’”"
