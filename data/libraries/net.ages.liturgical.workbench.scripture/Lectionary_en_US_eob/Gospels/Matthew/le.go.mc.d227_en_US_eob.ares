lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, “Why is it that your disciples do not live by the tradition of the presbyters, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?” Jesus answered them, “Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. And in vain do they express adoration before me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ Indeed, you set aside the commandment of God and hold fast to human tradition — the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.” He said to them, “How ingeniously do you reject the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition! For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother should be put to death.’ But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or mother, “Whatever [support] you might have received from me is Corban (that is, dedicated to God)”’ then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or mother. Thus, you nullify the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. And you do many [other] things like this.” Jesus called the entire crowd to himself and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand! There is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile; it is what comes out that defiles the person. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
