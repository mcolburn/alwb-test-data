lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees took counsel on how they might ensnare Jesus in his talk. They sent their own disciples to Jesus, along with the Herodians, and asked, “Teacher, we know that you are honest and that you teach the way of God in truth. You are not swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are. Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites? Show me the tax money.” Jesus asked them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” They answered, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” When they heard this [reply], they were amazed, and leaving him, they went away."
