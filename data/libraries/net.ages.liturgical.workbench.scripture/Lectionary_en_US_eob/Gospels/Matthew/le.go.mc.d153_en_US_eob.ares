Others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up. But because they had no depth of soil, when the sun rose, they were [quickly] scorched, and since they had no root, they withered away. Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
