lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when the people of land of Gennesaret recognized Jesus, they sent word into that entire surrounding region and people brought him all who were sick. They begged him to be able to just touch the fringe of his garment, and all those who touched it were healed. Scribes and Pharisees then came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying: “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the presbyters? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.” Jesus answered them, “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother should be put to death.’ But you say, ‘Anyone may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever support you might otherwise have received from me is now a gift devoted to God,” and is not bound to honor his father or mother.’ Thus, you have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaias prophesied about you quite well when he said: ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me! In vain do they express adoration to me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’ Jesus gathered the crowds and said to them, “Hear, and understand. What enters into the mouth does not defile a person, but what comes out of the mouth, this is what defiles a person.”"
