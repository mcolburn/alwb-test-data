lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “The lamp of the body is the eye! If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon. Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, wondering what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? See the birds of the sky: they do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them! Are you not of much more value than they? Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan? Why then are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil or spin, yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these! But if God clothes the grass of the field which today exists and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, you of little faith? Therefore, do not be anxious, saying: ‘What will we eat?,’ ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘What will we wear?’ It is the Gentiles who seek after all these things, but your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. Seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”"
