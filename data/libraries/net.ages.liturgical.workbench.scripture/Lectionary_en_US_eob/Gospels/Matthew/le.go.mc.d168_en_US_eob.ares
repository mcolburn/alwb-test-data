Whoever does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. The one who saves his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will obtain it. Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. Whoever receives a righteous person because of this person’s righteousness will receive the reward of the righteous. Amen, I tell you that whoever gives one of these little ones even just a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple will in no way lose his reward.” When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he left that place to teach and preach in their cities."
