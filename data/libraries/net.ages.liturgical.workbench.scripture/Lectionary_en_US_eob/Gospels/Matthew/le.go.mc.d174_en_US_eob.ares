lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples asked Jesus, saying, “Why then is it that the scribes say that Elias must come first?” Jesus answered them, “Elias indeed is coming first, and he will restore all things. But I tell you that Elias has already come, and they did not recognize him. Instead, they did to him whatever they wanted to. Likewise, the Son of Man will also suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. When they came to the crowd, a man came to Jesus. He knelt down before him and said: “Lord, have mercy on my son! He is epileptic and suffers terribly as he often falls into the fire and into the water. And so, I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.” Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring him to me.” When Jesus rebuked it, the demon went out of the boy and he was cured from that hour."
