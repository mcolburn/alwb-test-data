lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve disciples aside on the way, and said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and they will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, scourge and crucify him. And on the third day, he will rise again.” Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him. He said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.” But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” They said to him, “We are able!” Jesus answered, “You will indeed drink my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left, this is not mine to give! It is [reserved] for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” When the ten heard [about] this, they were upset with the two brothers. However, Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and great ones make their authority felt. But it shall not be so among you! Instead, whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant. Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”"
