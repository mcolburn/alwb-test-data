lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist! He is risen from the dead! That is why these powers work in him.” As it is, Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. For John had told him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” Even though Herod desired to have John put to death, he feared the crowds because they considered him to be a prophet. But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, Herodias’ daughter danced among them and pleased Herod, so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.” The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and because of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded that it be brought. Herod gave orders and had John beheaded in the prison. His head was brought on a platter, given to the young woman, and she brought it to her mother. John’s disciples came, took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from that place in a boat and went to a deserted place in private. When the crowds heard about this, they followed him on foot from the cities."
