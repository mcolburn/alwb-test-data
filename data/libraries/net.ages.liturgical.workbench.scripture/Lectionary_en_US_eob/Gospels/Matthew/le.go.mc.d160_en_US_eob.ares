lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field. When a man found it, he hid it again. In his joy, he then goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field! The Kingdom of Heaven is also like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls. Having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea which gathered fish of every kind. When the net was filled, people drew it up on the beach. They sat down and gathered the good [fish] into containers, but the bad [ones] they threw away. This is how it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from the righteous; they will cast them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Jesus asked them, “Have you understood all these things?” They answered him, “Yes, Lord.” He said to them, “Therefore, every trained person who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new and old things.” When Jesus had finished [speaking] these parables, he departed from there. Coming into his own country, he taught the people in their synagogue."
