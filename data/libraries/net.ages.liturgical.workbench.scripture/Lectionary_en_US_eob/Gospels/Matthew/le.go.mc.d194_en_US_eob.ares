lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “The one who endures to the end will be saved. This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. The one who is on the housetop should not [even] go down to carry out the things that are in the house. The one who is in the field should not [even] return to get his clothes. But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days! Pray that your flight will not be in the winter or a Sabbath day. For then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, and such as will never be again. Unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened. Then if any one tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There,’ do not believe it! False messiahs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders in order to lead many astray, and if possible, even the elect. Behold, I have told you this in advance. If therefore people tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’do not believe it! For as the lightning flashes from the east and is seen even to the west, this is how the coming of the Son of Man will be. For wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.”"
