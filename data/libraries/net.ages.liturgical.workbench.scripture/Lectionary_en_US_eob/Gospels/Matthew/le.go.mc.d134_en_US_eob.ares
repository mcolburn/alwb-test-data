lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, walking by the sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers: Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother. They were casting a net into the sea since they were fishermen. He said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fish for people!” Immediately, they left their nets and followed him. Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them. At once, they left the boat and their father, and followed him. Jesus traveled throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing all kinds of diseases and sickness among the people."
