lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and told them to go ahead of him to the other side, while he would send the crowds away. After he had sent the people away, he went up into the mountain by himself in order to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, because the wind was against it. In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea. When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled and said, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear. But at once, Jesus spoke to them, saying “Take heart! It is I! Do not be afraid.” Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, tell me to come to you upon the waters.” And Jesus said, “Come!” Peter stepped down from the boat and walked on the waters to come to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was strong, he became afraid and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” Immediately, Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of Peter, and said, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. Those who were in the boat came [forward] and expressed adoration to him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!”"
