lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus came into the house of Simon and Andrew, [along] with James and John. Now Simonâ€™s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately, they told him about her. Jesus came, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her and she began to serve them. At evening, when the sun had set, they brought him all who were sick or possessed by demons. The entire city was gathered at the door. He healed many who were afflicted with various diseases and cast out many demons. However, he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him to be the Christ . Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus arose, left the house, went out into a deserted place and prayed there."
