lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus arrived on the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two men possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs. They were extremely violent, so much that nobody could pass that way. Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding at some distance from them. The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of pigs.” He said to them, “Go!” The demons came out and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water. Those who fed them fled and went into the city where they told everything, including what had happened to those who were possessed with demons. Behold, the entire city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders. Jesus entered into a boat, crossed over [the lake] and came into his own town."
