lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a certain ruler came to Jesus and expressed adoration to him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples. Behold, a woman who had had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him and touched the fringe of his garment. [She did this because] she said within herself, “If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.” But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Daughter, rejoice! Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that very hour. When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, he saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion. He said to them, “Make room, because the girl is not dead, but sleeping,” and they started to ridicule him. But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took the girl by the hand and she arose. The report of this spread into the entire region."
