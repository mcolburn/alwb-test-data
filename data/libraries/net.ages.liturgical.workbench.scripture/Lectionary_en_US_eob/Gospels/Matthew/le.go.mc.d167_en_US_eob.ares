Great crowds came to Jesus, bringing with them the lame, blind, mute, crippled, and many others; and they put them down at his feet. So he healed them, and the crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel."
