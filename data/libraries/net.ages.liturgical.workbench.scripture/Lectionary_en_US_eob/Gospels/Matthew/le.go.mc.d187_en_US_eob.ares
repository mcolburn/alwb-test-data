Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and whoever it will fall on will be scattered as dust.” When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he had spoken about them. They began to look for a way to arrest Jesus, but they feared the crowds because the people considered him to be a prophet."
