lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees began to conspire with the Herodians against Jesus, [discussing] how they might get rid of him. Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great crowd followed him from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude of people, when they heard what great things Jesus was doing, came to him. Jesus instructed his disciples to have a little boat stay near him because of the crowd, so that they would not press on him. For he had healed many people, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him in order to touch him. The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!” He sternly warned them that they should not make him known."
