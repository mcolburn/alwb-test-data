lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, one of the rulers of the synagogue whose name was Jairus came forward. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet, and profusely begged him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death! Please come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made healthy and live.” Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed him. While he was still speaking, people came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, “Your daughter is dead! Why bother the Teacher any longer?” But as soon as Jesus heard the message, he immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid, only believe!” He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John (the brother of James). He arrived at the synagogue ruler’s house, and saw a commotion with weeping and great wailing. When Jesus had entered [the house], he said to them, “Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but asleep!” At this, they laughed at him. But Jesus, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went into the room where the child was lying. Taking the child by the hand, Jesus said to her, “Talitha cúmi!” which means, “Little girl, I tell you, get up!” Immediately, the girl (who was twelve years old) rose up and began to walk. At this, they were overcome with amazement. He strictly ordered them that no one should know this and told them to give her something to eat. Jesus left that place and came into his own country, and his disciples followed him."
