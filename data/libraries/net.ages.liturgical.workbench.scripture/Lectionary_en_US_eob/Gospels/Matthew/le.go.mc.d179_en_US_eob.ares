lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household and who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the laborers for a [salary of one] denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. [Later], he went out when it was about the third hour and saw other men standing idle in the marketplace. He told them, ‘You too should go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ And so, they went their way. Again, he went out when it was about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing. About the eleventh hour, he went out and still found others standing idle. He asked them, ‘Why do you stand here all day, doing nothing?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us!’ The master told them, ‘You too should go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ When evening came, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’ When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. Now when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, but they each likewise received one denarius. When they received it, they grumbled against the master of the household, saying: ‘These last [workers] have spent one hour, and yet you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’ But the master answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong! Did you not agree with me for one denarius? Take what is yours, and go your way. What if I wish to give to this last one just as much as to you! Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’ And so, the last will be first, and the first last! Indeed, many are called, but few are chosen.”"
