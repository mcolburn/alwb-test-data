lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “For as the lightning flashes from the east and is seen even to the west, this is how the coming of the Son of Man will be. For wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together. But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, the powers of the heavens will be shaken; and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other. Now learn this parable from the fig tree. When its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near. Likewise, when you see all these things, know that the time is near, even at the doors. Therefore, watch, because you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming. However, know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, be ready, for it is at an hour which you do not expect that the Son of Man will come. Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food in due season? Blessed is that slave whom his lord finds doing so when he comes. Amen, I tell you that he will set him over all that he has. But if that evil slave should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his return,’ and if he should begin to beat his fellow slaves and eat and drink with the drunkards, the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not expect it and in an hour when he does not know, and he will cut him into pieces and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. And there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”"
