lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the crowd away. After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray. When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea while Jesus was alone on the shore. Then he saw them being battered as they rowed, because the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed them by. But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost and cried out. They all saw him and were troubled, but immediately, Jesus spoke with them and said, “Rejoice! It is I! Do not be afraid!” He got into the boat with them and the wind ceased. They were utterly astonished beyond measure and marveled greatly because they had not understood about the [miracle of the] loaves, but their hearts were hardened. After crossing over, they came to the land at Gennesaret and moored the boat to the shore."
