lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Lord began to rebuke the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done, because the people did not repent. “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes! But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you! You, Capernaum, who [thought that you] were exalted to heaven, you will go down to hades! Truly, if the deeds of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this [very] day. But I tell you: on the day of judgment, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, than for you.” At that time, Jesus exclaimed, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the learned and intelligent, and revealed them to infants! Yes, Father, this was well-pleasing in your sight.”"
