I know who you are: the Holy One of God!” Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!” The unclean spirit, convulsing the man and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” The news about him went out immediately everywhere into the entire region of Galilee and its surrounding area."
