Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? Are not all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?” And they stumbled because of him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house!” He did not do many deeds of power there because of their unbelief."
