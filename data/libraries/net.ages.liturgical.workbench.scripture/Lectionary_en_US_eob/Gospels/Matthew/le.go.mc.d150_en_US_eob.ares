lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Pharisees went out and began to conspire against Jesus, [discussing] how they might destroy him. Perceiving it, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many [people] followed him and he healed them all, commanding them not to reveal who he was. Then a person possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him. Jesus healed him, so that the blind and mute man was now able to speak and to see. The crowds were amazed and exclaimed, “Can this be the Christ, the son of David?” However, when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man can only cast out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons!” Knowing their thoughts, Jesus told them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? If it is by Beelzebul that I cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges. However, if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you. Or how can someone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will [be able to] plunder his house. Whoever is not with me is against me! Whoever does not gather with me scatters!”"
