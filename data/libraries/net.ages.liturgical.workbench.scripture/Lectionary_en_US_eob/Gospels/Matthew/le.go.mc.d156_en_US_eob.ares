lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: “Why do you speak to them in parables?” He answered them, “To you, it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them, it is not given. Anyone who has will be given more and will have in abundance; but the one who does not have will be deprived even of what he has. Therefore, I speak to them in parables, so that seeing they may not see; and hearing they may not hear, nor understand, lest they should turn. In them, the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled, which says: ‘By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive: for this people’s heart has grown callous; their ears are dull of hearing, they have closed their eyes; otherwise, perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and should turn again; and I would heal them.’ But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and [blessed are] your ears, because they hear! Amen, I tell you that many among the prophets and the righteous desired to see what you see and they did not see them; and to hear what you hear, and [yet they] did not hear them. Hear, then, the parable of the farmer. When someone hears the word of the Kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in this person’s heart. This is what was sown by the roadside. The seed sown on the rocky places is when someone hears the word and immediately receives it with joy. Yet, this person has no root but endures only for a while. When oppression or persecution comes because of the word, this one immediately stumbles. What was sown among the thorns is when someone hears the word, but the anxieties of this age and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and so it produces nothing. What was sown on the good ground is when someone hears the word, understands it, and truly bears fruit, bringing forth, some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty times as much. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
