It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their friends and say, ‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance. We mourned for you and you did not lament!’ As it is, John came neither eating nor drinking, and so they say, ‘He has a demon!’ The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and so they say, ‘Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Nevertheless, Wisdom is justified by her children!” He then began to rebuke the cities in which most of his deeds of power had been done, because the people did not repent.”"
