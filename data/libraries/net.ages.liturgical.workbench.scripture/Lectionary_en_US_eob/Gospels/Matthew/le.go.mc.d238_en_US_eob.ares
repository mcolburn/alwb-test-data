lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “The Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise, and five were foolish. Those who were foolish took their lamps but brought no oil along with them, whereas the wise ones brought oil in their vessels along with their lamps. Now since the bridegroom was late, they all became tired and fell asleep. But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’ Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. The foolish virgins said to the wise ones, ‘Give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.’ But the wise virgins answered: ‘What if there is not enough for us and you? But go rather to those who sell [oil] and buy some for yourselves.’ While they went away to buy [oil], the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and then the door was shut. Afterwards, the other virgins also arrived and said: ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ But he answered, ‘Amen, I tell you that I do not know you!’ Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour that the Son of Man is coming.”"
