lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Amen, I tell you that whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven. Again, amen, I tell you that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. Indeed, where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there I am among them.” Then Peter came forward and asked Jesus, “Lord, how often shall I forgive my brother who sins against me? Until seven times?” Jesus said to him, “I do not tell you until seven times, but seventy times seven! When Jesus had finished [speaking] these words, he departed from Galilee and arrived at the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan. Great crowds followed him, and he healed them there. Then little children were brought to him so that he may lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples began to rebuke the people, but Jesus said, “Allow the little children and do not forbid them to come to me, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.” He laid his hands on them, and departed from that place."
