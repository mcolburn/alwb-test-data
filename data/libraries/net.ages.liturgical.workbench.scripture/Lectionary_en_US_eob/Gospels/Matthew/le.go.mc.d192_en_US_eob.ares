For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have not fulfilled the truly significant matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. It is these you should have practiced, without neglecting the others. You are blind guides who filter out a fly and yet swallow a camel! Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but inside, they are full of greed and unrighteousness. You blind Pharisees, first clean the inside of the cup and platter, so that the outside may also become clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside, they are full of dead bones and all [kinds of] impurity. Likewise, you also appear righteous to men outwardly, but inside, you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.”"
