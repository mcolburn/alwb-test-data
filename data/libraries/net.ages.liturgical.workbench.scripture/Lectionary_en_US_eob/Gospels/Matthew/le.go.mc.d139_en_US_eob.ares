lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his Disciples: “Whoever confesses me before men I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies me in front of others I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth! I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. Indeed, I came to set a son against his father, a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man’s enemies will be members of his own household.” When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he left that place to teach and preach in their cities."
