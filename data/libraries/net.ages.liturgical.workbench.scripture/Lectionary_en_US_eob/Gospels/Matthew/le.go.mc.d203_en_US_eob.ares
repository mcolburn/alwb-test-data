Behold, two blind men were sitting by the road, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, son of David!” The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but the blind men cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, son of David!” Jesus stood still and called them, asking, “What do you want me to do for you?” They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened!” Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they began to follow him."
