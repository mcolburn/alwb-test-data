lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, another large crowd was [assembled] there and the people had nothing to eat. Jesus called his disciples to himself and told them, “I have compassion on the people because they have stayed with me for three days now, and they have nothing to eat. If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come from far away.” His disciples replied, “From where could we satisfy these people with bread, here, in a deserted place?” Jesus asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven.” Jesus directed the crowd to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. After giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the people. They also had a few small fish. After blessing them, Jesus also told them to serve the fish. The people ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. There were about four thousand [people]. After this, Jesus sent them away. Right after this, he got into the boat with his disciples and arrived into the region of Dalmanutha."
