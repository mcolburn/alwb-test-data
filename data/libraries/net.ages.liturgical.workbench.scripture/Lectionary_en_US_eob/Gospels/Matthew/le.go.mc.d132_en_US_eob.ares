The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then, they will fast. No one puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment because the patch would [shrink and] tear away from the garment, and a worse hole would be made. Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”"
