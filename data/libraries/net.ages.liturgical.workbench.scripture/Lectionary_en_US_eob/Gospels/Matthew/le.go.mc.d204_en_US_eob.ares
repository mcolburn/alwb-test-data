lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a man came to Jesus, and kneeling before him asked, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do in order to have eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” The man asked him, “Which ones?” Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not bear false witness.’ ‘Honor your father and mother;’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” The young man then said to him, “All these things I have observed from my youth! What do I still lack?” Jesus replied, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, give it to the poor, and you will have [a] treasure in heaven. Then come, and follow me!” But when the young man heard these words, he went away sad because he was a person with great possessions. Jesus said to his disciples, “Amen I say to you: it will be hard for someone who is rich to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven! Indeed, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.” When his disciples heard this, they were extremely astonished and said, “Who then can be saved?” Gazing at them, Jesus answered, “By human resources, this is impossible, but with God all things are possible!”"
