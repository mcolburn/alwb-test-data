Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but only my Father. As in the days of Noah, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Therefore, watch, because you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming. However, know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, be ready, for it is at an hour which you do not expect that the Son of Man will come.”"
