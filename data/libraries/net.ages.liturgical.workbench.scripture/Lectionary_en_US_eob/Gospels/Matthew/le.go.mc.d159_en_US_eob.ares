lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went into the house, and His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the grass weeds of the field.” He answered them, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, the good seeds are the children of the Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one. The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. As the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire, so will it be at the end of this age. The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do evil, and he will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
