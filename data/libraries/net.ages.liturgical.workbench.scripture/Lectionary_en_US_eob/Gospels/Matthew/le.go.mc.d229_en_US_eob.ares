lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went away to the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, yet he could not escape notice. Having heard about Jesus, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit came and fell down at his feet. Now this woman was a Greek, of Syro-Phoenician descent. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the little dogs!” But she answered, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs!” Jesus said to her, “For saying this, you may go your way! The demon has gone out of your daughter.” She went away to her house and found the child lying on the bed, the demon having gone out."
