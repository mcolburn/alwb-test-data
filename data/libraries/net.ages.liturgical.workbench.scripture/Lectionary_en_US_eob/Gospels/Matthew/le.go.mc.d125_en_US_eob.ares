lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not swear falsely; you must fulfill your vows to the Lord.’ But I tell you: do not swear at all! Neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Do not even swear by your head because you cannot make a single hair white or black. Instead, let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’ and your ‘No’ be ‘No.’ Whatever goes beyond these is from the evil one. You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I tell you: do not resist one who is evil, but to whoever strikes you on your right cheek, present the other cheek as well. If anyone sues you to take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him for two.”"
