lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the apostles came back together around Jesus and told him both what they had done and taught. Because there were many [people] coming and going, the apostles did not even have time to eat. Jesus then said to them, “You should go away into a deserted place and rest for a while.” They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. The multitudes saw them going away and many recognized Jesus. People rushed there on foot from all the [surrounding] cities and arrived before the disciples, and came together to him. Jesus came out, saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. He then began to teach them many things. When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, “This place is deserted and it is late in the day! Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy bread, for they have nothing to eat.” But Jesus answered them, “You give them something to eat!” They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?” Jesus replied, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they had found out, they said, “Five loaves and two fish.” Jesus gave them instructions that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass, and people sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves. He then gave it to the disciples to set before the people, and he distributed the two fish among them all. Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the [leftover] fish. Those who ate the loaves numbered five thousand men. At once, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the crowd away."
