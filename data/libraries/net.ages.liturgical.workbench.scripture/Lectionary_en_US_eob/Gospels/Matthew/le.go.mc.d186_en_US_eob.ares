lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said this parable: “A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’ The son answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he was sorry and went. The father came to his second son, and said the same thing. The son answered, ‘I will go, sir,’ but he did not go. Which one of the two sons did the will of his father?” They replied, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Amen, I tell you that tax collectors and prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of God before you! For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. After seeing this, you did not even repent and you did not believe him."
