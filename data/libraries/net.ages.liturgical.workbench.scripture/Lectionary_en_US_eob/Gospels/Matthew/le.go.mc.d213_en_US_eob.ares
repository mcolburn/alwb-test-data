lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Pay attention to what you hear! With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to those who hear. For whoever has will receive even more, but to the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” Jesus said, “The Kingdom of God is as if a man would scatter seed on the ground, and then go to sleep. Night and day, whether he sleeps or rises, the seed springs up and grows, even if he does not know how. For the earth bears fruit: first the blade comes, then the head, then the full grain in the head. But when the fruit is ripe, at once the man pulls out his sickle, because the harvest has come.” Jesus said, “How shall we compare the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? It is like a grain of mustard seed sown in the ground. Even though it is smaller than all the seeds on earth, when it is sown and grows up, it becomes greater than all garden plants! It puts out great branches and the birds of the sky can find shelter under its shade.” Using many parables like these, he spoke the word to the people, as much as they were able to hear it. He would not speak the word to them except in parables, but to his disciples he explained everything in private."
