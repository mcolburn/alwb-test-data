lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, some of the scribes and Pharisees came to Jesus saying: “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you!” But Jesus answered, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to this generation except for the sign of Jonah the prophet. For just as Jonah the prophet was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The people of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, someone greater than Jonah is here! The queen of the south will stand up in the judgment with this generation and she will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, someone greater than Solomon is here! After an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he wanders through dry places seeking rest and does not find it. He then says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came out,’ and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order! Then he goes [around] and brings with himself seven other spirits more evil than he, and they enter in and dwell there. And so, the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. This is how it will be with this evil generation.”"
