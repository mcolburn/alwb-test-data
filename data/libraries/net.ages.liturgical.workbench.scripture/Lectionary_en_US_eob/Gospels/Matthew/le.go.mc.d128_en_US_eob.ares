Seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a snake? If you then who are evil [still] know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good [things] to those who ask him!”"
