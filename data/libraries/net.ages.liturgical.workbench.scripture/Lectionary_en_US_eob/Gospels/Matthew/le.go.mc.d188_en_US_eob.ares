lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to Jesus. They asked him [a question], saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother shall marry his wife and have a posterity for his brother.’ Now there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no descendant he left his wife to his brother. In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh. After them all, the woman also died. In the resurrection therefore, which one of the seven brothers will have her as wife, for they all had her as wife?” But Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God. For in the resurrection, people neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like the angels of God in heaven. However, concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying: ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’ God is not the God of the dead, but of the living!” When the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his teaching."
