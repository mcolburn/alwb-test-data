lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went up into the mountain and called to himself those he wanted and they came to him. He appointed twelve to be with him, so that he might send them out to preach and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons. [They were:] Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter; James the son of Zebedee and John, the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges which means ‘Sons of Thunder;’ Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananite; and Judas Iscariot, who was to betray him. Jesus returned [to his] home and again, the crowd assembled, so much that they could not even eat bread. When his own [friends] heard it, they came to take charge of him, saying, “He is insane!”"
