lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus, calling to himself the Twelve, began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. He told them to take nothing for their journey, except for a staff: no wallet, no bread, no money in their purse. He also told them to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. He said to them, “Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from the area. And whoever does not welcome you or listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Amen, I can tell you that in the day of judgment, things will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city!” They went out and preached that people should repent. They also cast out many demons and anointed with oil many people who were sick and healed them."
