Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the waves swept over the boat, but Jesus was asleep. His disciples came to him and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!” He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then he stood up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”"
