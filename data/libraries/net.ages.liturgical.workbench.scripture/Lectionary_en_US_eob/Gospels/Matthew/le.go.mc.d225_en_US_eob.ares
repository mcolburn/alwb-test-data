lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a lawyer came to Jesus and asked him a question in order to test him. “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and great commandment. The second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ The entire law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.” Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them a question, saying, “What do you think of the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They answered, “[He is the son] of David.” Jesus said to them, “How, then, does David, in the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?’ If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?” No one was able to answer him a word, and from that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions."
