lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and showed him the buildings of the temple. But Jesus told them, “You see all of these things, do you not? Amen, I tell you that not one stone will be left standing on another; all will be thrown down.” As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him in private, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” Jesus answered them, “Be careful not to be led astray! For many will come in my Name, saying: ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many people astray. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. Do not be troubled; all of this must take place, but the end is not yet. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are [only] the beginning of the birth pains. Then they will deliver you up to oppression and they will kill you. You will be hated by all the nations for my Name’s sake. Many will stumble and will betray and hate each other. Many false prophets will arise and they will lead many astray. Because wickedness will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.”"
