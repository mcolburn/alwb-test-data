lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus then spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses. Therefore, whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but do not imitate their works; for they preach and [yet] do not act accordingly. Indeed, they bind heavy burdens that are dreadful to bear and put them on people’s shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them. Instead, they do all their works to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad, they enlarge the fringes of their garments, and love the place of honor at feasts. They love the best seats in the synagogues, the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by people. But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers. Call no man on the earth ‘your father,’ for one is your Father, he who is in heaven. And do not be called ‘teacher,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ. Instead, the one who is the greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
