lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus called the entire crowd to himself and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand! There is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile; it is what comes out that defiles the person.” When he had entered into a house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Do you not yet perceive that whatever goes into someone from the outside cannot defile that person because it does not go into his heart but into the stomach, and then into the sewer (thus he declared all foods to be clean) ?” He said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles that person. Indeed, it is from within, out of human hearts, that evil thoughts proceed: adultery, sexual immorality, murder, theft, greed, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. All these evil things come from within and make a person unclean.” From there, he arose and went away to the borders of Tyre and Sidon."
