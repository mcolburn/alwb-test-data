lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when John heard about the works of Christ from his prison, he sent two of his disciples to ask him, “Are you the one who comes or should we look for another?” Jesus replied to them, “Go and tell John about the things you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up and the poor have Good News preached to them. Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.” As they went their way, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses! But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet! Indeed, he is the one of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ Amen, I tell you: among those born of women, there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer! Yet the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John [came]. If you are willing to accept it, this [ John] is Elias who was to come. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
