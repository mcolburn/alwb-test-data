lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David!” When he entered the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They replied, “Yes, Lord.” He then touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith, let it be done to you!” And their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.” However, they went out and spread his fame throughout that entire land. As they were leaving, behold, a mute man who was demon-possessed was brought to him. When the demon was cast out, the mute began to speak. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of the demons that he casts out demons.” Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom. He also healed every kind of disease and sickness among the people."
