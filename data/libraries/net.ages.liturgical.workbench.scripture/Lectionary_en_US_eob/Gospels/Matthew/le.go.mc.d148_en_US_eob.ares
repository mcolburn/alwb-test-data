lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, imploring him and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.” Jesus answered, “I will come and heal him.” But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof! Only say the word and my servant shall be healed. As it is, I am also a man under authority, having soldiers under my own authority. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and if I tell another, ‘Come,’ he comes. Or if I tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ he does it!” When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed, “Amen, I tell you that I have never found so great a faith, not even in Israel! I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven. But the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” And his servant was healed in that hour."
