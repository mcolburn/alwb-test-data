lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a great multitude followed Jesus, pressing upon him on all sides. There was a certain woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years. She had endured much at the hands of many physicians and spent all that she had. Yet, she was not feeling better but worse. Having heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes. For she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well!” And immediately, the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. Jesus, perceiving in himself at once that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?” His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you ask, ‘Who touched me?’” Jesus looked around to see the woman who had done this. But she, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came forward and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. Jesus said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well! Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”"
