lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Amen, all human sins will be forgiven, and all the blasphemies ever uttered; but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal condemnation.” [He spoke these words] because they had said, “He has an unclean spirit!” His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, sent in a message asking for him. A large group was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, looking for you.” He answered them, “Who are my mother or my brothers?” Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”"
