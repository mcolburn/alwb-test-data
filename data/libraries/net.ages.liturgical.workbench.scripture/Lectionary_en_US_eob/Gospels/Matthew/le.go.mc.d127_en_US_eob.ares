lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Whoever confesses me before men I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies me in front of others I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.” Then Peter said, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” Jesus said to them, “Amen, I tell you that you who have followed me, at the regeneration, when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or lands for my Name’s sake will receive a hundred times [more] and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first!”"
