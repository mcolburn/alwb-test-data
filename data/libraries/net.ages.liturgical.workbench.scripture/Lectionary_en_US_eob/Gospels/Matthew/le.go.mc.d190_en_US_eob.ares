lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, a man came to Jesus. He knelt down before him and said: “Lord, have mercy on my son! He is epileptic and suffers terribly as he often falls into the fire and into the water. And so, I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.” Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring him to me.” When Jesus rebuked it, the demon went out of the boy and he was cured from that hour. Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why were we not able to cast it out?” Jesus replied, “Because of your unbelief! Amen, I tell you that if you have faith [even] like a grain of mustard, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you! But this kind [of spirit] does not go out except by prayer and fasting.” While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and the third day, he will be raised up.”"
