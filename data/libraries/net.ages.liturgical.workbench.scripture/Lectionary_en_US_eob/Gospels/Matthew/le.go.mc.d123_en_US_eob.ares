lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his Disciples: “Indeed, I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. You have heard that it was said of old, ‘You shall not murder;’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be in danger of the judgment.’ But I tell you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. Whoever calls his brother ‘Raca!’ shall be answerable to the Sanhedrin; and whoever shall say, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna. If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift there, before the altar. First, go your way and be reconciled to your brother, and then offer your gift. Find an agreement with your adversary as soon as possible, even as you are on your way to court, fearing that perhaps the prosecutor will deliver you to the judge, the judge deliver you to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Amen, I tell you: you will not get out of there until you have paid the last penny.”"
