If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you! Indeed, it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. It was also said, ‘Whoever shall divorce his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce,’ but I tell you that whoever divorces his wife (except for the case of sexual immorality), makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a woman put away in this manner commits adultery.”"
