lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” At this, they reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread!” Perceiving this, Jesus said, “You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand or remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered up? Or do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up? How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!” Then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
