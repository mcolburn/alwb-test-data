lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his Disciples: “When they persecute you in this city, flee into another. Amen, I tell you: you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher and the slave like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household! Therefore, do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed and nothing hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops. Do not be afraid of those who [can] kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father’s will, but the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore, do not be afraid! You are of more value than many sparrows!”"
