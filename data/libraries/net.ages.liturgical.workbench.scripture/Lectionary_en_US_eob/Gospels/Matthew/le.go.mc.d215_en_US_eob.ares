lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus arrived on the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gergesenes. As soon as Jesus came out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the [nearby] tombs. This man lived in the tombs and no one was able to bind him any more, not even with chains. (He had often been chained hand and foot but had torn the chains apart and broken the foot-shackles in pieces). Indeed, nobody had the strength to control him. Night and day, he remained in the tombs and the mountains, howling and cutting himself with stones. When this man saw Jesus from afar, he ran and expressed adoration to him. He cried out with a loud voice, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? By God’s Name, do not torment me!” (For Jesus had just said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”) Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He answered, “My name is Legion, for we are many!” He implored Jesus not to expel them from the earth. Now there was a great herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside. All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, so that we may enter into them.” At once, Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea. Those who fed the pigs ran away and told the story in the [nearby] town and countryside. The people then came out to see what had taken place. They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind. This was the very man who had [been possessed by] the legion [of demons,] and they were afraid. The eyewitnesses reported to them what had happened to the man who was possessed by demons and [also] to the pigs. Then they began to beg Jesus to leave their region. As Jesus was entering into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged to be allowed to stay with him. But Jesus did not allow him, saying to him, “Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.” The man went off on his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone was amazed."
