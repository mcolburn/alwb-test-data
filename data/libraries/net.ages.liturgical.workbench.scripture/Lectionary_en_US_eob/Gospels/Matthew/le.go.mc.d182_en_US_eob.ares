lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus called his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd because they have remained with me for three days now and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they might faint on the way.” His disciples said to him, “But where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place in order to satisfy such a great multitude?” Jesus asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven, and a few small fish.” Jesus then told the people to sit down on the ground and took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples distributed [the food] to the multitudes. Everyone ate and was satisfied. They gathered up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. Then Jesus sent the people away, got into the boat, and came to the borders of Magdala."
