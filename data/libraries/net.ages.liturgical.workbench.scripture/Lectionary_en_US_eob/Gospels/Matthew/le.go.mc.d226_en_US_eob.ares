lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when they came out of the boat, the people immediately recognized Jesus. They swarmed that whole surrounding region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard that he was. Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or country, people laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him to be able to touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well. Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem and gathered to [see] Jesus. When they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with defiled (that is, unwashed) hands, they found fault. (For the Pharisees and all the Jews hold to the tradition of the presbyters and do not eat unless they wash their hands and forearms. [Also], they do not eat when they return from the marketplace unless they [first] bathe themselves; and there are many other things which they have received and observe: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) Then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why is it that your disciples do not live by the tradition of the presbyters, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?” Jesus answered them, “Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. And in vain do they express adoration before me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ Indeed, you set aside the commandment of God and hold fast to human tradition.”"
