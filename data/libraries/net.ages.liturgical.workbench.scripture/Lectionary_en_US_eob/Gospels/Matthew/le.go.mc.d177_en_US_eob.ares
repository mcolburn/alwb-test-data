lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?” Jesus called a little child to himself and set him in their midst. He then said, “Amen, I tell you that unless you change and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. But whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever receives such a little child in my Name receives me, but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for such a person to have a huge millstone hung around the neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea! Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! Such occasions are bound to come, but woe to the one through whom the occasion does come! If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut them off and throw them away from you! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or maimed rather than to have two hands or two feet and yet be cast into eternal fire. If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than to be cast into the Gehenna of fire having two eyes. Do not despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven, their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.”"
