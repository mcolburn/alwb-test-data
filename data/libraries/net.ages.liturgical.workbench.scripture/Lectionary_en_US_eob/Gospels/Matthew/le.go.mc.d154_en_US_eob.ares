Jesus said to him, “Follow me,” and the man got up and began to follow him. It so happened that as Jesus was sitting in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came [in] and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” When Jesus heard it, he told them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ for I did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.”"
