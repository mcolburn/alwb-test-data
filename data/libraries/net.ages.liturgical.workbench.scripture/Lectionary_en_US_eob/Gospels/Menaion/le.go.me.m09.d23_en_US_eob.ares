lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, in the days of Herod king of Judea, there lived a priest named Zacharias who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. Both of them were righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. Yet, they had no child because Elizabeth was barren, and both were well advanced in years. Now it came to pass that while Zacharias was performing his priestly office before God in the order of his division, according to the custom of the priest’s office, that his lot was [drawn] to enter into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense. Now at the time of the incense offering, the whole multitude of the people was praying outside. Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. Zacharias was startled when he saw the angel and was gripped with fear. But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your petition has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. Indeed, he will be great in the sight of the Lord! He will drink no wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. He will bring back many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. He will go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elias (Elijah), ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years!” The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel who stands near before God. I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. Behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.” The people were waiting for Zacharias and wondering as he delayed in the sanctuary. When he came out, he could not speak to them and they understood that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He continued to make signs to them and remained mute. When the days of his service were fulfilled, Zacharias returned to his house. After these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying: “The Lord has done this to me in the days when he looked at me, in order to take away my disgrace among men.”"
