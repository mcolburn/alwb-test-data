lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the twelve came to him and said, “Send the people away, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms to find lodging and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.” But Jesus said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They replied, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.” (For they were five thousand men). Jesus then said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” They did so, and made them all sit down. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude. Everybody ate, and all were satisfied. The disciples gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over. Once, as Jesus was praying alone and the disciples were with him."
