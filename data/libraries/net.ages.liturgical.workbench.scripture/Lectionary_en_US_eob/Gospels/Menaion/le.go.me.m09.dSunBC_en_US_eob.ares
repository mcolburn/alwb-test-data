And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, likewise, the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone believing in him should not perish but have eternal life. Indeed, God so loved the world that he gave his uniquely-begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. Certainly, God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world should be saved through him.”"
