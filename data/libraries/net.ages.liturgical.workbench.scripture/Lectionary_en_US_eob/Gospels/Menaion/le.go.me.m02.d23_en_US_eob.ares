Whoever loves his life will lose it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life. Anyone who serves me must follow me! Where I am, there will my servant also be. The Father will honor anyone who serves me. Jesus therefore said to the crowd, “The light is with you a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you. Whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.”"
