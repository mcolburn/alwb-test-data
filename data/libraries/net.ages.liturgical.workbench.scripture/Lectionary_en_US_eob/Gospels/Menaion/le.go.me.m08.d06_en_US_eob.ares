As he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling. And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elias. They appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem. Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. As Moses and Elias were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elias.” He did not know what he was saying. While Peter was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud. A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” And after the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent and told no one in those days of what they had seen."

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and he brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. [There], he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. And behold, Moses and Elias appeared to them, talking with him. Peter then said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you want, let us make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elias.” While Peter was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.” When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were very afraid. Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up, and do not be afraid.” Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone. As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave them this order: “Do not tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen again from the dead.”"
