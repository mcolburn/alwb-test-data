For the Son of Man has come to save the lost. What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine to go into the mountains and look for the one that has gone astray? Amen, I tell you: if he finds it, he rejoices over this one more than over the ninety-nine which did not go astray. Likewise, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that any of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother! But if he does not listen, take one or two more with you, so that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the Church. If he refuses to hear the Church also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. Amen, I tell you that whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will have been loosed in heaven. Again, amen, I tell you that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. Indeed, where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there I am among them.”"

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.” The seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your Name!” Jesus said to them, “I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven! Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I confess you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for doing so was well-pleasing in your sight.”"
