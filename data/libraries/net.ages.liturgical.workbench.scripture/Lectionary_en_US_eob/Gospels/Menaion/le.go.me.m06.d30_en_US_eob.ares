lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when Jesus saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them because they were weary and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. He then said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful indeed, but the workers are few! Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out workers into his harvest.” Jesus called to himself his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and sickness. The names of the Twelve apostles are: first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James [the son] of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, the one called Thaddaeus; Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Jesus sent these Twelve out and gave them this instruction: “Do not go among the Gentiles and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans. Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, preach and say: ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’ Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead , and cast out demons. Freely you have received, give freely as well.”"
