lemeMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, the news concerning Jesus spread throughout Judea and in all the surrounding countryside. John’s disciples told him about all these things. John called two of his disciples and sent them to Jesus to ask, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?” When the men reached Jesus, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying: ‘Are you the one who is coming or should we look for another?’” At that very time, Jesus had been healing many diseases, plagues and evil spirits; and had given sight to many who were blind. Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have Good News preached to them. Blessed is he who is not offended by me!” When John’s disciples had departed, Jesus began to tell the multitudes about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed and live delicately are in kings’ courts. But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet! This is he of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer; yet whoever is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.” Hearing this, all the people and the tax collectors who had been baptized with John’s baptism confessed God to be vindicated. However, the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected God’s purpose, not being baptized by him themselves."

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when John heard about the works of Christ from his prison, he sent two of his disciples to ask him, “Are you the one who comes or should we look for another?” Jesus replied to them, “Go and tell John about the things you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up and the poor have Good News preached to them. Blessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.” As they went their way, Jesus began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses! But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet! Indeed, he is the one of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ Amen, I tell you: among those born of women, there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer! Yet the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John [came]. If you are willing to accept it, this [John] is Elias who was to come. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”"
