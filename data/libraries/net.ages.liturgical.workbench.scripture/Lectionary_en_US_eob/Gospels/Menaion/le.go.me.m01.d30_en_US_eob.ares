I came so that people may have life, and have it in abundance. I am the good shepherd! The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The one who is a hired hand, not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, leaves the sheep and flees when he sees the wolf coming. Then the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them. The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and does not care for the sheep. I am the good shepherd! I know my own, and I am known by my own; even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. And there will be one flock—one shepherd.”"

Neither do you light a lamp and place it under a measuring basket, but on a stand. And so it shines to all who are in the house. Likewise, let your light shine before all, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Do not think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I did not come to destroy, but to fulfill! Amen, I tell you: until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished. Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments and teach others to do so shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.”"
