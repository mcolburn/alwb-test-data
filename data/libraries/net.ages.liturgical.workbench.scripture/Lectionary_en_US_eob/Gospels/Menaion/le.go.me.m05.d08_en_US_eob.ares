When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own home. This is the disciple who bears witness about these things and who wrote these things. We know that his testimony is true. There are also many other things which Jesus did. If they were all written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen."

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me because I am gentle and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls. Indeed, my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”"
