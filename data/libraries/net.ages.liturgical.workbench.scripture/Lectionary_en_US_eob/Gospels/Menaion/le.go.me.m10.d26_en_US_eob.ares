But it will turn out for you as an occasion to bear witness. Therefore, settle it in your hearts not to ponder in advance how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or withstand. You will be handed over even by parents, relatives, friends, and brothers. Some of you will be put to death. You will be hated by all for my Name’s sake, yet not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance acquire your lives.”"

If you were of the world, the world would love its own! But you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, and so the world hates you. Remember what I told you: ‘A bondservant is not greater than his lord.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But they will do all these things to you on account of my Name, because they do not know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin! Whoever hates me also hates my Father. If I had not accomplished among them the works which no one else had done [before], they would not have had sin. But now, they have seen [those things] and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this has happened so that the word which was written in their law may be fulfilled: ‘They hated me without reason.’ But when the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness to me. You also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.” “I have told you these things, so that you would not be made to stumble. They will expel you from the synagogues! Yes, the time is coming when whoever kills you will think that he is offering service to God!"
