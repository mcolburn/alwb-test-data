lemeMA.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Father, glorify your Name!” Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.” At this, the multitude who stood by heard it, and they said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes. Now judgment is upon this world! Now the ruler of this world will be cast out! And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all [people] to myself.” But he said this to indicate by what kind of death he should die. The multitude answered him, “We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’ Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus therefore said to them, “The light is with you a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you. Whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.”"

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, all the chief priests and the presbyters of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate saying: “Crucify! Crucify him!” Pilate answered, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I find no basis for a charge against him.” The Jews insisted, “We have a law, and according to our law, he should die, because he made himself the Son of God.” However, when Pilate heard these words, he was even more afraid. Returning into the Praetorium, he asked Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. Then Pilate asked him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have the power to crucify you, and the power to release you?” Jesus answered, “You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore, he who delivered me to you has a greater sin.” When Pilate heard this word, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement,” and in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.” Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!” But they shouted, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!” Pilate asked them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!” And so, Pilate delivered Jesus to them to be crucified. Then the guards took Jesus and led him away. He went out, bearing his cross, to the place called “The Place of a Skull,” which is called in Hebrew, “Golgotha.” There they crucified him, and along with him two other men, one on each side and Jesus in the middle. Pilate also wrote a notice and had it placed on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” Many of the Jews read this inscription because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister (Mary [the wife] of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own home. After this, perceiving that all things were now accomplished, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."
