lemeLI.Gospel.text = "Αt that time, the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in [the act of] adultery to Jesus. Making her stand before them all, they told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such [a person]. What then do you say?” They said this to test him, in order to have something to accuse him of. However, Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground. But as they continued to ask him, he looked up and said to them, “Let the one who is without sin among you throw the first stone at her.” Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger. When they heard this, they began to leave, one by one, starting from the oldest. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle. Standing up, Jesus said, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?” She said, “No one, Sir.” Jesus replied, “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way! And from now on, sin no more.”"
