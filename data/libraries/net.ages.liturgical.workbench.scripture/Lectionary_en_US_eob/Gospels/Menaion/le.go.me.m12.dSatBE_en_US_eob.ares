lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, John the Baptizer came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying: “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!” This is the one whom Isaias (Isaiah) the prophet had spoken about in these words: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight! It was peculiar about John that he wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. Soon, people from Jerusalem, all of Judea and the entire region around the Jordan river went out to [listen to] him. They were baptized by John in the Jordan, confessing their sins."
