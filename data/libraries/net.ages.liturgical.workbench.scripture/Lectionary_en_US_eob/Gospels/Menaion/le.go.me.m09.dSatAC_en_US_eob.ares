lemeLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “I am going away; you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you cannot come.” At this, the Jews said, “Will he kill himself, since he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come?’” Jesus said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. I told you therefore that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.” Therefore, they asked him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning! I have much to say concerning you and [much] to condemn. However, he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these [things] I say to the world.” They did not understand that he spoke to them about the Father. So Jesus said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am. I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me, this is what I proclaim. The one who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to him.” As he spoke these things, many believed in him."
