Do also [right] here in your hometown whatever we have heard that was done at Capernaum!’” Jesus continued, “Amen, I tell you that no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. But I tell you in truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came all over the land. Elias was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.” As they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with anger. They rose up, threw Jesus out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill that their city was built on in order to push him off the cliff. But passing through their midst, he went his way."
