lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when the days were near for him to be taken up, that he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem, and he sent messengers ahead of him. They went and entered into a village of the Samaritans in order to make preparation for him. But the people did not receive him because he was heading for Jerusalem. When his disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them, just as Elias did?” But Jesus turned around and rebuked them: “You do not know of what kind of spirit you are. The Son of Man did not come to destroy people’s lives but to save them.” And they went on to another village. Now it happened that as they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord!” All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, or who the Father is, except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” Turning to the disciples, Jesus said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but they did not see them; and to hear what you hear, but they did not hear them.” Jesus was on his way through cities and villages, teaching and traveling onward to Jerusalem."
