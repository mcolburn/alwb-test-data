However, know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore, be ready, for it is at an hour which you do not expect that the Son of Man will come. Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food in due season? Blessed is that slave whom his lord finds doing so when he comes. Amen, I tell you that he will set him over all that he has."
