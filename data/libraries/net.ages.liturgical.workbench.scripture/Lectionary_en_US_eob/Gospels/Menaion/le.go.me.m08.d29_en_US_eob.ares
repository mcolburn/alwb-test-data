lemeMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist! He is risen from the dead! That is why these powers work in him.” As it is, Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. For John had told him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” Even though Herod desired to have John put to death, he feared the crowds because they considered him to be a prophet. But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, Herodias’ daughter danced among them and pleased Herod, so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.” The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths and because of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded that it be brought. Herod gave orders and had John beheaded in the prison. His head was brought on a platter, given to the young woman, and she brought it to her mother. John’s disciples came, took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from that place in a boat and went to a deserted place in private. When the crowds heard about this, they followed him on foot from the cities."

lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, King Herod heard this report, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the dead! This is why these powers are at work in him!” But others said, “He is Elias.” Others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets [of old]!” But when he heard this, Herod said, “This is John whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead!” For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested, and he had him chained in prison. This was for the sake of Herodias, the [former] wife of his brother Philip, for Herod had married her. John had said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!” Herodias became furious against John and desired to kill him, but she could not because Herod feared John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard John speak, he did many things, and liked to listen to him. An opportunity came when on his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, high officers, and for the leading figures of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those sitting with him, the king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you!” He swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom!” She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?” Herodias answered, “The head of John the Baptizer!” At once, the girl hurried to the king and said, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.” The king was extremely sorry, but for the sake of his oaths and because of his dinner guests, he did not wish to deny her. Immediately, the king sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded that John’s head be brought. The soldier went off and beheaded John in the prison, and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl. And she gave it to her mother. When John’s disciples heard this, they came, took his body, and laid it in a tomb. The apostles came back together around Jesus and told him both what they had done and taught."
