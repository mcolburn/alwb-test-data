lemeLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, just as it was told them. When the eight days were fulfilled and the time came for the circumcision of the child, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. His parents went every year to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. When they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother did not notice it. Supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey and began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances. When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. After three days, they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. All who heard him were amazed by his understanding and answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.” He said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he said to them. After this, he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was obedient to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, as well as in favor with God and men."
