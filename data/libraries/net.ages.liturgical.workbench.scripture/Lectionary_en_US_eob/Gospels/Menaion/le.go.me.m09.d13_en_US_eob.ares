lemeLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said: “Whoever loves his life will lose it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life. Anyone who serves me must follow me! Where I am, there will my servant also be. The Father will honor anyone who serves me. Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this time?’ But I have come to this time for this reason. Father, glorify your Name!” Then there came a voice out of heaven, saying, “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.” At this, the multitude who stood by heard it, and they said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes. Now judgment is upon this world! Now the ruler of this world will be cast out! And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all [people] to myself.” But he said this to indicate by what kind of death he should die. The multitude answered him, “We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’ Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus therefore said to them, “The light is with you a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you. Whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.”"
