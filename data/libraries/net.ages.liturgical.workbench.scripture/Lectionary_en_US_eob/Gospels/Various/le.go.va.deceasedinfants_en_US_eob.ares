levaLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, people were also bringing their infants to Jesus, so that he might lay hands on them. But when the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. Jesus summoned his disciples and told them, “Allow the little children to come to me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Amen, I tell you: whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will in no way enter into it.” Those who heard this exclaimed, “Then who can be saved?” But Jesus replied, “The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.” Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you!” And Jesus said to them, “Amen, I tell you: there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God, who will not receive many times more in this [present] time, and in the age to come, eternal life.”"
