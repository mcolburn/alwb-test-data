lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, one of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night, and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God because no one can performs the signs which you accomplish unless God is with him.” Jesus answered him, “Amen, amen, I tell you; unless one is born anew, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.” Nicodemus asked him, “How can someone who is old be born? Can one enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born [anew]?” Jesus answered, “Amen, amen, I tell you; unless one is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God! What is born of the flesh is flesh. What is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’ The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus said, “How can this be?” Jesus replied and said, “You are the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things? Amen, amen, I tell you; we speak of what we know, and [we] bear witness to what we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony. If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you [about] heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven, except for the one who came down out of heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, likewise, the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone believing in him should not perish but have eternal life."
