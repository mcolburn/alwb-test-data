But I told you that you have seen me, and yet, you do not believe. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who is coming to me I will in no way reject. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but [to do] the will of the one who sent me. This is the will of my Father who sent me: that of all he has given me, I should lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.”"
