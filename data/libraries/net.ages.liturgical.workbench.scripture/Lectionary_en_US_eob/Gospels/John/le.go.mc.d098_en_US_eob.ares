You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free!” They answered him, “We are Abraham’s seed and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, ‘You will be made free?’” Jesus answered them, “Amen, amen, I tell you; everyone who practices sin is the slave of sin! A slave does not live in the house forever, [but] a son remains forever. If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed! I know that you are Abraham’s seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.” They answered him, “Our father is Abraham! Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham. But now, you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God! Abraham did not do this. You do the works of your father.” They replied to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality! We have one father, God.” Therefore, Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, for I issue forth [from God] and have come from God."
