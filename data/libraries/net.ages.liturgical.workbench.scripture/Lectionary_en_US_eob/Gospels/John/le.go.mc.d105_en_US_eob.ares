lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give eternal life to them; they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.” Again, the Jews picked up rocks to stone him. Jesus told them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those do you stone me?” The Jews answered him, “We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God.” Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods?’ If he called them gods, those to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, do you say of him whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God?’ If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me. But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may recognize and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.”"
