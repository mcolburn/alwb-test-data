lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, there was a certain royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. Jesus then said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will never believe!” The nobleman replied, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” Jesus told him, “Go on your way. Your son lives.” So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and he went on his way. Even as he was on the way, his slaves met him and told him the news: “Your child lives!” He asked them the hour when the boy had begun to get better. Then they told him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him!” And so, the father learned that it was at that [very] hour in which Jesus had said to him, “Your son lives.” And he believed, along with his whole household. This was the second sign that Jesus performed on his return from Judea into Galilee."
