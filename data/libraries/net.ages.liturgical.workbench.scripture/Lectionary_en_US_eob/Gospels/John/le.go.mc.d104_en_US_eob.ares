lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “Therefore, the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, so that I may take it again. No one takes my life away from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.” Once again, a division arose among the Jews on account of these words. Many of them said, “He has a demon and he is insane! Why do you listen to him?” Others said, “These are not the sayings of someone possessed by a demon. It is not possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?” At that time, it was the Feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. The Jews therefore gathered around him and asked him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s Name, these bear witness to me. But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you. My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give eternal life to them; they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."
