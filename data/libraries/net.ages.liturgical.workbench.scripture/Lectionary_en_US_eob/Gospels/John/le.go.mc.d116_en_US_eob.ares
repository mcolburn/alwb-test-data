lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Everything the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take of [what is] mine and will declare it to you. In a little while, you will not see me, and then after a little while you will see me because I go to the Father.” At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he is saying to us, ‘In a little while, you will no longer see me, and then after a little while you will see me’ and, ‘because I go to the Father?’” And so they kept asking, “What is this that he says, ‘A little while?’ We do not understand what he is saying!” Now Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him [about these things], and he said to them, “Are you discussing among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘In a little while, you will no longer see me, and then after a little while you will see me?’ Amen, amen, I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy! When a woman gives birth, she has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she does not remember the anguish any more because of the joy that a human being is born into the world. Therefore, you now have sorrow, but I will see you again; and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you! In that day you will ask me no [more] questions. Amen, amen, I tell you; whatever you may ask of the Father in my Name, he will give it to you.”"
