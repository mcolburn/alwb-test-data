lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For the Father has sealed him—[even] God!” As a result, they asked him, “What must we do, that we may accomplish the works of God?” Jesus replied, “This is the work of God, that you believe in the one whom he has sent!” So they replied, “What then do you do for a sign, so that we may see and believe you? What work do you accomplish? Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness! As it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.’” Jesus therefore said to them, “Amen, amen, I tell you; it was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. For the bread of God is what comes down out of heaven, and [it] gives life to the world.”"
