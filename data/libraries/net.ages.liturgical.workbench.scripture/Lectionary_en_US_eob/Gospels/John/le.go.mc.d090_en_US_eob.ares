lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had believed in him: “I am the bread of life! Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven. Its purpose is that anyone may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. Anyone who eats of this bread will live forever! Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.” At this, the Jews disputed with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” Jesus therefore said to them, “Amen, amen, I tell you; unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves. The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”"
