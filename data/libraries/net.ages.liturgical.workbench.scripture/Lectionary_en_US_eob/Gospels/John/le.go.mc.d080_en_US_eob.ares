Certainly, God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but so that the world should be saved through him. Anyone who believes in him is not judged, but whoever does not believe has already been judged, because such a person has not believed in the Name of the only-begotten Son of God. This is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people have loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, for fear that his works would be exposed. But whoever practices the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be revealed as done in God.”"
