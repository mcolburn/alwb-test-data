lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples, “Do not let your heart be troubled. Have faith in God! Have faith also in me! In my Father’s house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and receive you to myself, so that where I am, you may be there also. You know where I am going, and you know the way.” Thomas asked him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going! And how can we know the way?” Jesus replied to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. And from now on, you know him, and you have seen him.” Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us!” Jesus answered, “I have been with you for such a long time, and still, do you not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father! So how can you say, ‘Show us the Father?’ Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words that I tell you, I do not speak from myself, but the Father who lives in me accomplishes the works. Believe me that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me."
