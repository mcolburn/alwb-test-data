lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited with his disciples to the wedding. When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.” Jesus said to her, “Woman, what [is that] to you and me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he tells you to do, do it.” Now six water jars made of stone were set there, meant for the rites of purification of the Jews, and they each contained two or three measures. Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water!” So they filled them up to the brim. He then said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward of the feast.” And they did so. When the chief steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine (not knowing where it had come from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and after the guests have drunk freely, then the inferior one. But you have kept the good wine until now!” This, the beginning of his signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him."
