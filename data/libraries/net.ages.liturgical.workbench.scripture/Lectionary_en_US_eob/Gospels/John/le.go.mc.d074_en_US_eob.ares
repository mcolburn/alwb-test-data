lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, John was standing with two of his disciples. He looked at Jesus as he was walking by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” The two disciples heard him speak, and they began to follow Jesus. Turning and seeing them following, Jesus asked them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?” First disciples Jesus said to them, “Come and see!” They came therefore and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. (It was about the tenth hour). One of the two who heard John and who began to follow Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. He first found his own brother, Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which translated means Christ). And Andrew brought him to Jesus who looked at him, and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Kephas” (which translated means Peter). On the next day, being determined to go out into Galilee, Jesus met Philip and said to him, “Follow me!” Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, “We have found the one of whom Moses in the law and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph!” Nathanael asked him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see!” As Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, he said about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” Nathanael asked Jesus, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” Nathanael replied, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!” Jesus said to him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” He said to Philip, “Amen, amen, I tell you; hereafter, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”"
