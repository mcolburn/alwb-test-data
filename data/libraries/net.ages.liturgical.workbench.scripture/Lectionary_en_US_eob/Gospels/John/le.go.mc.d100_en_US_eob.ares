lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “If God were your father, you would love me, for I issue forth [from God] and have come from God. Indeed, I have not come of myself, but he has sent me. Why do you not understand my speech? Because you cannot hear my word! You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and he does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he utters a lie, he speaks of his own because he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? Whoever is of God hears the words of God. For this reason, you do not hear: because you are not of God.” Then the Jews answered him, “Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. However, I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. Amen, amen, I tell you; whoever keeps my word will never see death.”"
