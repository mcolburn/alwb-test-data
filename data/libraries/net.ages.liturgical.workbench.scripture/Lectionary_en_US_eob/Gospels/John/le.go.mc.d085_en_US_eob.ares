lemcMA.Gospel.text = "On the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. So they entered in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. Terrified, the women bowed their faces to the ground. The two men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but he is risen! Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and [on] the third day rise again?” Then they remembered Jesus’ words. Returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the others. Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary [the mother] of James, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles. But their words seemed to be nonsense to them, and they did not believe them. However, Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves. He returned to his home, wondering what had taken place."

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Joseph of Arimathea (a prominent council member who was also looking for the Kingdom of God), came forward. He boldly went in to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. Pilate wondered if Jesus was already dead. Calling the centurion, he asked him whether Jesus had been dead for a long time. Having been assured of this by the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. Accordingly, Joseph bought fine linen, took Jesus down and wrapped him in the linen cloth. Having placed him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock, he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where Jesus had been laid. When the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices in order to come and anoint him. Very early on the first day of the week, they arrived at the tomb when the sun had risen. They were saying among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?” But when they looked up, they saw that the stone was [already] rolled back, although it was extremely large. Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. He said to them, “Do not be amazed! You seek Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen! He is not here! Behold, the place where they laid him! But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he told you.’” They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come upon them. They said nothing to anyone because they were afraid."
