lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead, and Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?” Peter replied, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs.” Again, Jesus asked a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?” Peter replied, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.” A third time, Jesus asked, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?” Peter was grieved because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you have affection for me?” He said, “Lord, you know everything! You know that I have affection for you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep! Amen, amen, I tell you; when you were young, you dressed yourself, and you walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.” Now Jesus said this to indicate by what kind of death Peter would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to Peter, “Follow me!” Then Peter, turning around, saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the disciple who had also reclined near Jesus’ breast at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”) Peter, seeing him, asked Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?” Jesus answered, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.” Therefore, this saying went out among the brethren, that this disciple would not die. Yet, Jesus did not say to him that this disciple would not die, but, “If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you?” This is the disciple who bears witness about these things and who wrote these things. We know that his testimony is true. There are also many other things which Jesus did. If they were all written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen."
