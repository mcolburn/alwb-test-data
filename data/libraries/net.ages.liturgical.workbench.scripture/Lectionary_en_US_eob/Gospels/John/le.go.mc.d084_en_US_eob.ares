lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, when the people saw the sign which Jesus had accomplished, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into the world!” Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force in order to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself. When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea where they got into the boat and headed across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not returned to them. Because a great wind was blowing, the sea became rough. After rowing about three or four miles, the disciples saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat. And they were frightened, but Jesus said to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid!” At this, they were willing to receive him into the boat, and immediately, the boat reached the shore where they were going. On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, (except the one in which his disciples had embarked,) and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone. However, [a few] boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. And so, when the multitude noticed that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to seek Jesus. When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you arrive here?” Jesus answered them, “Amen, amen, I tell you; you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied. Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For the Father has sealed him—[even] God!”"
