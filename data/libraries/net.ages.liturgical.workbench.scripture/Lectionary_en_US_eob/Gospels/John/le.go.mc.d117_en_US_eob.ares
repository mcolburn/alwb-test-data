lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “In that day you will ask me no [more] questions. Amen, amen, I tell you; whatever you may ask of the Father in my Name, he will give it to you. Until now, you have asked nothing in my Name. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete! I have told you these things in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. In that day, you will ask in my Name. And I do not tell you that I will pray to the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and believed that I came forth from God. I came forth from the Father, and I have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and return to the Father.” His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you speak plainly, not in figures of speech. Now we know that you know all things and we do not need for anyone to ask questions from you. By this we believe that you came forth from God.” Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? Behold, the time is coming, yes, and it has now come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will desert me. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace.”"
