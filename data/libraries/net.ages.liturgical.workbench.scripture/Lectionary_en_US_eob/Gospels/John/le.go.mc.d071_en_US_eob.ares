lemcVE.Gospel.text = "After the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to roll away the stone from the door, and [the angel] sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. Out of fear, the guards were shaken and became as dead. The angel told the women, “Do not be afraid! I know that you seek Jesus who has been crucified. He is not here, for he is risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, this is my message for you.” They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to report it to his disciples. As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came forward and took hold of his feet, and expressed adoration to him. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brethren that they should go into Galilee. There, they will see me.” While they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all the things that had happened. When they were assembled with the presbyters in order to take counsel, they gave the soldiers a large amount of silver, with these words: “Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” And so, they took the money and did as they were told. This story is widespread among the Jews to this day. The eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them. When they saw him, they expressed adoration to him, but they doubted. Jesus came to them and said, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go [therefore] and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all the things that I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen!"

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This one was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him, nothing came into being that has come into being. In him was life, life that was the light of mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. John came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but [he was sent] to bear witness to the light. The true light who enlightens everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world had come into existence through him, and the world did not recognize him. He came to his own [people], and those who were his own did not receive him. But as many as received him, to them he gave the ability to become God’s children, to those who believe in his Name. They were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We beheld his glory, glory as a Father’s uniquely-begotten son, full of grace and truth. John testified about him; he cried out, saying, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’” And from his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses, [but] grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
