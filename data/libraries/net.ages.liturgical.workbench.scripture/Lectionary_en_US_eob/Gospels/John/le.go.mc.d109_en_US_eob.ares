lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he left and hid from them. Still, even though he had performed so many signs in front of them, they did not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaias the prophet: Lord, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? For this reason, they could not believe, for Isaias said elsewhere: He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them. Isaias said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him. However, even many among the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees, they did not confess it [openly], so that they would not be put out of the synagogue, for they loved human praise more than God’s praise. Jesus cried aloud, “Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in the one who sent me! Whoever sees me sees the one who sent me. I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the dark. If anyone listens to my sayings and does not believe, I do not judge this person. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world!"
