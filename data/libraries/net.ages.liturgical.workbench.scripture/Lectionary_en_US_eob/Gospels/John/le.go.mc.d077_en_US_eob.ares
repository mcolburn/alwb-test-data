lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized. John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there, and people came, and [they] were baptized. (For John had not yet been thrown into prison). Now a discussion arose on the part of John’s disciples with a [certain] Jew about ceremonial washing. They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, this one is [now] baptizing, and everyone is coming to him!” John answered, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’ He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands [by] and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. And so my joy is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease.” He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and he speaks from the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. And what he has seen and heard is what he bears witness to, but no one accepts his testimony. He who has accepted his testimony has set his seal [to this], that God is true."
