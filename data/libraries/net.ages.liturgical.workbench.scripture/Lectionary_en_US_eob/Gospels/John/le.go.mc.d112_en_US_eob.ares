Believe me that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me; or else believe me on account of the works themselves. Amen, amen, I tell you; whoever believes in me will also accomplish the works that I accomplish and will do [even] greater works than these, because I am going to my Father. Whatever you will ask in my Name is what I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you will ask anything in my Name, I will accomplish it. If you love me, keep my commandments! I will pray to the Father and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever, the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him and does not know him. But you know him, because he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you orphans! I will come to you! In a short time, the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live! In that day, you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, that person is the one who loves me. Whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love and reveal myself to such a person.”"
