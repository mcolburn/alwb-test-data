lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had believed in him: “The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and [as] I live because of the Father, whoever eats me will also live because of me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven. Unlike your ancestors [who] ate the manna and [still] died, whoever eats this bread will live forever!” He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. Therefore, many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?” But knowing in himself that his disciples grumbled at this, Jesus said to them, “Does this cause you to stumble? What then if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and [they] are life. But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him. He said, “For this reason, I have told you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.” At this, many of his disciples left and no longer walked with him. Then Jesus said to the Twelve, “Do you also want to leave?” Then Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life! We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”"
