lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went about in Galilee; he did not wish to travel around in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill him. Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Tabernacles, was at hand. So his brothers said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, so that your disciples may also see your works which you are accomplishing. Certainly, no one who seeks to be known openly does anything in secret! If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world!” For even his brothers did not believe in him. Jesus therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I bear witness concerning it, that its works are evil. You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.” Having said these things to them, he remained in Galilee. However, when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were, in private. As a result, the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and they were asking, “Where is he?” There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man!” Others replied, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray!” Still, no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jews."
