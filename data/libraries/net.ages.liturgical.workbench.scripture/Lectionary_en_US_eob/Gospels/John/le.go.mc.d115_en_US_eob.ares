lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to his disciples: “Yes, the time is coming when whoever kills you will think that he is offering service to God! They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me. But I have told you these things, so that when the time arrives, you may remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the beginning because I was with you. But now, I am going to him who sent me, and none of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’ But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. Yet, I tell you the truth; it is to your advantage that I go away because if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; about sin, because they do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more; about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. I still have many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth.”"
