lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “Amen, amen, I tell you; whoever keeps my word will never see death.” At this, the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, and [so did] the prophets; and [yet] you say, ‘whoever keeps my word will never see death.’ Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died [as well]. Who do you claim to be?” Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God. You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I do not know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I [do] know him, and I keep his word. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad!” At this, the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?” Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I tell you; before Abraham came into existence, I am.” Therefore, they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and having gone through their midst and so passing by, he went out of the temple."
