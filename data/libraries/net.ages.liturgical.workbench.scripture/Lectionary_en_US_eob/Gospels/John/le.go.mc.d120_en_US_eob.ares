At this, the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Then again, Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.” When he had said this, he breathed on them and told them, “Receive the Holy Spirit! If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s sins, they are retained.”"

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and spoke loudly, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! From within whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will flow rivers of living water!” But he said this concerning the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. When they heard this saying , many of the people said, “This is truly the prophet!” Others said, “This is the Christ!” Still others said, “What? Does the Christ come out of Galilee? Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?” And so, there arose a division in the crowd because of him. Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. And so, the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why did you not bring him?” The officers answered, “No one has ever spoken like this man!” At this, the Pharisees replied, “You are not also led astray, are you? Have any of the rulers believed in him, or the Pharisees? But this multitude that does not know the law is accursed.” Nicodemus (who had come to him by night, being one of the Pharisees ) said to them, “Does our law judge someone without first hearing from him personally to find out what this person is doing?” They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.” Then again, Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.”"
