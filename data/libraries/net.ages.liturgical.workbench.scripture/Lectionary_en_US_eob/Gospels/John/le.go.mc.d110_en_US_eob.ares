lemcMA.Gospel.text = "Now after Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told [this to] those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. When they heard that Jesus was alive and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. After these things, he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country. They went on their way and told it to the rest who did not believe them, either. Afterward, Jesus was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen. He said to them, “Go into the whole world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; but whoever disbelieves will be condemned. These signs will accompany those who believe: they will cast out demons in my Name; they will speak with new languages; they will take up snakes; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.” And so, the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the signs that accompanied them. Amen."

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus having risen from the dead, stood among his disciples and said to them: “Peace be to you!” But they were startled and frightened, supposing that they had seen a spirit. He said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see! A spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.” When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. While they still did not believe for joy and were perplexed, he said to them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and a honeycomb from a beehive. He took them, and ate in front of them. He said to them, “This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that everything written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms concerning me must be fulfilled.” He then opened their minds, so that they might understand the Scriptures. He said to them, “This is what is written, that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his Name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you are witnesses of these things! Behold, I send the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.” He led them out as far as Bethany, lifted up his hands, and blessed them. It happened, while he was blessing them, that he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven. They expressed adoration to him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy; and they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
