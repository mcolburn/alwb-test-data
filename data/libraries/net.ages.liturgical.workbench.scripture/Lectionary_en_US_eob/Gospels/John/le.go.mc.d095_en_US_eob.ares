lemcLI.Gospel.text = "When it was the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach. At this, the Jews were amazed and said, “How does this man have such learning without having been educated?” Jesus therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but [it comes] from the one who sent me. Anyone who desires to do God’s will, will recognize the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself. Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true, and [there is] no unrighteousness in him. Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why [then] do you seek to kill me?” The crowd replied, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?” Jesus answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel because of it. Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath, you circumcise a boy. If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, [why] are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? Do not judge according to appearance, but make a right judgment.” Then some people from Jerusalem said, “Is this not the one whom they seek to kill? Behold, he is speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Could it be indeed that the rulers acknowledge that this is truly the Christ? However, we know where this man comes from! But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.” Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, and you do not know him. I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.” At this, they sought to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come."
