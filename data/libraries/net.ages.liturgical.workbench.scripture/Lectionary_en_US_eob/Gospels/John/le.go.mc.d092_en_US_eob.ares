lemcMA.Gospel.text = "At that time, Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves. He returned to his home, wondering what had taken place. It then happened that two of the disciples were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about all of these things which had taken place. And as they were talking together and discussing this, Jesus himself came near and went along with them. However, their eyes were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, “What are you talking about as you walk?” And they stopped walking, looking sad. One of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know what has happened there in these days?” “What things?” he asked to them. They replied, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene! He was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and had him crucified. But we were hoping that he was the one who would redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things have taken place. Also, certain women of our company have puzzled us: having arrived early at the tomb, they did not find his body. And they came back saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive! Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him.” He said to them, “You foolish men! So slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter into his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. As they were approaching the village where they were going, he acted like he would continue on his way. “Stay with us!” they urged him, saying, “It is almost evening, and the day is almost over!” So he went in to stay with them. Now it happened that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them. And their eyes were opened; they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. Then they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together and [also] those who were with them. They were saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!” Then the two related what had happened along the way, and how they had recognized him in the breaking of the bread."

lemcLI.Gospel.text = "At that time, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now in Jerusalem, by the sheep gate, there is a pool with five porches called in Hebrew “Bethesda.” Under these lay a great multitude of people who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Then whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had. A certain man was there, who had his illness for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and perceived that the man had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?” The sick man replied, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I am coming, someone else steps down before me!” Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk!” Immediately, the man was made well; he took up his mat and began to walk. Now it was the Sabbath on that day. And so, the Jews said to the man who had been cured, “It is the Sabbath! It is not lawful for you to carry the mat!” The man answered them, “He who made me well, that one said to me, ‘Take up your mat, and walk.’” Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your mat, and walk?’” But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn in the crowd that was there. Later, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you!” The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well."
