lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “My Father is still working, and I am also working.” Because of this, the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, not only because he broke the Sabbath, but also because he called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. Accordingly, Jesus answered them, “Amen, amen, I tell you; the Son can do nothing of himself, but [only] what he sees the Father doing. Indeed, whatever the Father does, the Son also does likewise. For the Father has deep affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. And the Father will show him greater works than these, so that you may be astonished. For [just] as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, likewise the Son also gives life to whom he desires. As it is, the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him! Amen, amen, I tell you; the one who hears my word and believes in him who sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.”"
