lemcLI.Gospel.text = "The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him: “As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.” “If I bear witness about myself, my testimony is not valid. There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony by which he bears witness about me is true. You have sent [messengers] to John, and he has testified to the truth. However, the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things so that you may be saved. John was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, because the works which the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, they bear witness about me, that the Father has sent me. The Father himself, who sent me, he has testified about me. You have never heard his voice at any time, and you have never seen his outward appearance. You do not have his word living in you, because you do not believe the one whom he sent. Search the Scriptures, for you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me. Yet you will not come to me to have life. I do not receive glory from men, but I know you, that you do not have God’s love in yourselves. I have come in my Father’s Name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him! How can you believe, since you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is in fact Moses, on whom you have set your hope. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?” After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee (or [also called] Tiberias). A great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he accomplished on those who were sick."
