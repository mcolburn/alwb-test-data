lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, live wisely before those who are ‘outside,’ and make the most of your time. Let your speech always be pleasant, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to properly answer those who have questions. All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, a faithful servant and fellow bondservant in the Lord. I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here. Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions, “if he comes to you, receive him”), and also Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God who are of the circumcision, and they have been my consolation. Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you. Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea; and also Nymphas, along with the Church which meets in his house. When this letter has been read among you, please have it also read in the Church of the Laodiceans; and also read the letter from Laodicea. Tell Archippus this: “Be mindful of the ministry which you have received in the Lord, and fulfill it.” Here is my greeting: Paul, with my own hand! Remember my chains. Grace be with you! Amen."
