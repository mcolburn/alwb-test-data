lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one; for this reason, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying: I will declare your Name to my brethren. In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise. Again: I will put my trust in him, and: Behold, here I am with the children whom God has given me. Since the children have shared in [the same] flesh and blood, he likewise shared the same [human nature], so that through death he might bring to nothing the one who had the power of death—the devil—and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to life-long slavery. Certainly, Jesus did not take on the [nature of] angels, but [that of] Abraham’s seed. For this reason, he had to be made like his brethren in all things, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, {able} to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Moreover, since he himself suffered and was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
