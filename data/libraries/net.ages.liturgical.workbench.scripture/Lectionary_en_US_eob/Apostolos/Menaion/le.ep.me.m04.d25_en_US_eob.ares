lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in due time. Cast all your worries on him, because he cares for you. Be sober, self-controlled, and watchful. Your adversary, the devil, roams about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brethren throughout the world experience the same sufferings. But after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, will make you perfect, restore you, and make you strong, firm, and steadfast. To him be the glory and the power unto ages of ages. Amen. Through Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son. Greet one another with a kiss of love! Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus! Amen."
