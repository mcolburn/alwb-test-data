lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. As it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing. Where is the wise? Where is the expert of the law? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God ridiculed the wisdom of this world? Since in God’s wisdom, the world through its ‘wisdom’ did not know God, it was God’s good pleasure (through the foolishness of this proclamation) to save those who believe. Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks. However, to those who are called, (both Jews and Greeks), Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God."
