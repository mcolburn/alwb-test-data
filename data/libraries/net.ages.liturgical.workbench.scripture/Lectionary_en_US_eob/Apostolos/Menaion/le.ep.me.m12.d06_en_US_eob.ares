This way, they will be able to do this with joy and not with grief because that would not be profitable for you. Pray for us: we trust that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things. I strongly urge you to pray for this: that I may be restored to you sooner. Now may the God of peace, who with the blood of an eternal covenant brought back from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, make you complete in every good work so that you may do his will. May God work in you what is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory unto ages of ages. Amen."
