lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, remember your leaders, those men who proclaimed the word of God to you. Considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do not be carried away by all sorts of strange teachings. It is good that the inner person should be strengthened by grace, not by food which is of no profit to those who have been preoccupied by it! We have an altar from which those who offer divine service [in] the holy tabernacle have no right to eat. For the bodies of those animals (whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin) are burned outside of the camp. This is why Jesus suffered outside of the gate, so that he might sanctify the people through his own blood. Let us therefore go out [of the city] to him who is outside of the camp and let us bear his disgrace. For we do not have here [on earth] an enduring city, but we seek the one that is to come. Therefore, through him, [Jesus], let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, the fruit of our lips which confessed his Name. But do not forget to do what is good and to share because God is well pleased with such sacrifices."
