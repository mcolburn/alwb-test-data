lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, those who have served well earn for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. I write to you these things, hoping to come to you shortly. If I am delayed, I want you to know how the people should behave in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. Without a doubt, great is the mystery of godliness: God was revealed in the flesh, vindicated in [the] spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in glory. The Spirit clearly says that in the last times, some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron. They forbid marriage and command to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. Everything that God has created is good and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving. Indeed, it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer."
