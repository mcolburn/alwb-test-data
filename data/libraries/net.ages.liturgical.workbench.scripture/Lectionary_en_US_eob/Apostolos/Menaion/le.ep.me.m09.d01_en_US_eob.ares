Indeed, this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who desires all people to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth. There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for allâ€”this testimony [was given] in its own times. I was appointed a preacher and an apostle of these things (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
