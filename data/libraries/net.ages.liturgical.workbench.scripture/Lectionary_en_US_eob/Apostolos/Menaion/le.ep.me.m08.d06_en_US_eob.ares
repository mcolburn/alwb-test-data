lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, do all that you can to make your calling and election assured. For if you do these things, you will never stumble. Thus, you will be richly granted the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Therefore, I will not be negligent to remind you of these things although you [already] know them and are established in the truth which you now have. I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you [of these things]. I know that I shall lay aside my tent very quickly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. And so, I will make every effort [to ensure] that you will always be able to remember these things, even after my departure. Certainly, we did not depend on cleverly invented fables when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; we were eyewitnesses of his majesty! For he received from God the Father honor and glory when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” We heard this voice come out of heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. Therefore, we have the word of prophecy made even more certain, and you should pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts."
