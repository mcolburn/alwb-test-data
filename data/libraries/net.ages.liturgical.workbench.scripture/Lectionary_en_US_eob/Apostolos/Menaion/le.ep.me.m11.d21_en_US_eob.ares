lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the first tabernacle and covenant had ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary. A tabernacle was set up: the lampstand, the table, and the show bread were in the first part which is called the Holy Place. Beyond the second veil was found the tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies. It had a golden altar of incense and the Ark of the Covenant all covered with gold. The Ark contained a golden jar holding the manna, Aaronâ€™s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. Above it, cherubim of glory overshadowed the mercy seat, but now we cannot speak about these things in detail. According to this arrangement, priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle, accomplishing the rites of offering divine service. Into the second [tabernacle], only the high priest enters, once a year and with blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people."
