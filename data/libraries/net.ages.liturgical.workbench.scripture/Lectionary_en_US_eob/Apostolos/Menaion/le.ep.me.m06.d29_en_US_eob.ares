lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I say this to our shame: we were too weak for that! However, if anyone is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold as well. Are they Hebrews? So am I! Are they Israelites? So am I! Are they Abraham’s seed? So am I! Are they Christ’s servants? I am even more so (I speak as a fool)! I was in far more labors, beaten countless times, far more often in prisons, and often close to death. Five times, I was beaten with stripes (forty times minus one) from the Jews. Three times, I was beaten with rods. Once, I received a stoning. Three times, I suffered shipwreck and was for a night and a day in the open sea. I have been in travels often, in danger from rivers, robbers, from my countrymen, from the Gentiles; in danger in the city, in the wilderness, at sea, among false brothers; in toil and hardship, in vigils often, in hunger and thirst, often fasting, and in cold and nakedness. Besides those things which are external, there is something that comes upon me daily: anxiety for all the Churches. If anyone is weak, do I not feel weak too? If anyone stumbles, do I not burn with indignation? But if I must boast, I will boast about those things that have to do with my weakness. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed unto the ages, knows that I do not lie. In Damascus, the governor of King Aretas guarded the city, desiring to arrest me. But I was let down in a basket along the wall through a window, and this is how I escaped from his hands. Without a doubt, it is not profitable for me to boast, but I will now discuss visions and revelations from the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up into the third heaven (whether [it was] in the body, I do not know, or whether out of the body, I do not know; God knows). [Yes], I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I do not know; God knows), how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard ineffable words, which it is not lawful for anyone to utter. On behalf of such a person, I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. If my intention is to boast, I will not be foolish: I will speak the truth. But now, I shall stop, so that no one may think more of me than what is seen in me or heard from me. Because of the tremendous greatness of these revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan that torments me, so that I would not be too exalted. Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me, but he replied to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” And so, it is with joy that I would rather [find] glory in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me."
