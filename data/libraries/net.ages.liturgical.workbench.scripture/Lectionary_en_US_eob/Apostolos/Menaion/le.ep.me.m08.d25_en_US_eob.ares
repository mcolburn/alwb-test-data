lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ [appointed] to bring Godâ€™s elect to faith and to the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness, and also to the hope of eternal life, which God (who cannot lie) promised before the age began. In his own time, he revealed his word in the message I was entrusted with according to the commandment of God our Savior. To Titus, my true child according to the faith which we share: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. I left you in Crete for this reason: that you would set in order the things that were amiss and appoint presbyters in every city, as I directed you: Teach these things, exhort and reprove with complete authority. Let no one despise you! Remind the people to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient and ready for every good work, not speaking evil of anyone and not contentious. They should also be gentle, showing great humility toward everyone. When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, do your utmost to meet me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to spend the winter there. Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily and see that they lack nothing. Make sure that our people also learn to maintain good works to meet urgent needs, so that they may not be unfruitful. All who are with me greet you! Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all! Amen."
