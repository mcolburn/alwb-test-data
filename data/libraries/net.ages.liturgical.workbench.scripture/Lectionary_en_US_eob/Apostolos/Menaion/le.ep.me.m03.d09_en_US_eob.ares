lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, seeing that we are surrounded by such a great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us. Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith. For the joy that was set before him, he endured the cross, despising its shame, and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who has endured such opposition from sinners, and you will not grow weary or faint in your souls. In your own battle against sin, you have not yet struggled to the point of shedding blood. Have you forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children: My child, do not take lightly the chastening of the Lord, do not faint when you are reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves, he also chastens, and he disciplines every son whom he receives. Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children, for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? But if you are not getting this discipline (as you are), this makes you illegitimate, not children! Moreover, we had biological fathers to chasten us, and we respected them. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of {our} spirits, and live? Our fathers punished us for a few days as seemed good to them; but God does so for our benefit, so that we may be partakers of his holiness."
