To one, the word of wisdom is given through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge, [both] according to the same Spirit. To another, faith [is given] by the same Spirit, and to yet another gifts of healings, [both] by the same Spirit. To another it is given to work miracles and to another prophecy. Another receives the discerning of spirits, another different kinds of tongues, and another [yet] the interpretation of tongues. However, it is the one and same Spirit who works all of these, distributing to each one individually as he intends."
