To those who are under the law, [I became] as under the law, so that I might gain those who are under the law. To those who are without law, [I became] as one without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), so that I might win those who are without law. To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some. Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, so that I may be a joint partaker of it. Do you not know that those who run in a race run with everyone else, but that only one receives the prize? Run like that, in order to win! Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it in order to receive a corruptible crown, but we [seek] an incorruptible crown. This is how I run, not without a goal. This is how I fight, not beating the air! Instead, I chastise my body and bring it into submission, for fear that after having preached to others, I myself should be disqualified."
