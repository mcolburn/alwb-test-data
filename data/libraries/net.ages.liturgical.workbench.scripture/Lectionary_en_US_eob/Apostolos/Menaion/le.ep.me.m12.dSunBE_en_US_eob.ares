As for me, I am already being offered in sacrifice, and the time of my release has come. I have fought the good fight! I have finished the course! I have kept the faith! From now on, the crown of righteousness is reserved for me, which the Lord—the righteous judge—will give me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all those who have loved his appearing."
