lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, nobody will question that the lesser is blessed by the greater. Here, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. We can say that through Abraham even Levi (who would [later] receive tithes), had paid tithes, for he was still ‘in the body’ of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him. Now if perfection had come through the Levitical priesthood (under which the people received the law), what further need would there be for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not that of Aaron? And as the priesthood is being changed, there is also, by necessity, a change in the law as well. So our Lord, of whom these things were said, belongs to another tribe, one from which no one has served at the altar. It is clear indeed that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, about which Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. This is even more obvious if after the likeness of Melchizedek, another priest was to rise, one who was not made in virtue of a law of physical descent but according to the power of an indestructible life. For he testifies: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
