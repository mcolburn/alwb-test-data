lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if the word spoken through angels proved reliable and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty, how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation! It was first announced by the Lord himself, and it is confirmed to us by those who heard him. God also bore witness with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will. Indeed, God did not subject the world to come (which we proclaim) to angels, but there is a place {in Scripture} where someone has testified: What is man that you should be concerned for him? Or the son of man, that you care for him? You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor. You have put all things in subjection under his feet. Since God has subjected all things to him, he has left nothing that is not subject to him! But now, we do not see all things subjected to him, [at least not] yet. However, we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, [that is] Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he should taste death for everyone. Indeed, it was fitting for God, (for whom are all things and through whom are all things), in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
