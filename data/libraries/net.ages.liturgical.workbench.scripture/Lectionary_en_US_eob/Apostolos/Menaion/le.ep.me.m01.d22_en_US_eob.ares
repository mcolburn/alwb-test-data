I always remember you in my petitions, night and day, longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy. I also remember your sincere faith which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice. I am convinced [that it dwells] in you also! For this reason, I am reminding you to rekindle the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. Therefore, do not be ashamed to be a witness of our Lord or ashamed of me his prisoner. Share in my tribulations for the sake of the Good News, by the power of God."
