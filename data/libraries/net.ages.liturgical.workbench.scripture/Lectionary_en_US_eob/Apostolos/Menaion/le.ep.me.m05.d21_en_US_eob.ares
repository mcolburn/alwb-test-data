lemeLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Agrippa said to Paul, “You may speak for yourself.” Then Paul held up his hand and made his defense. “As I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests, at noon, O king, I saw on the way a light from the sky. It was brighter than the sun and shone around me and those who were traveling with me. We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads!’ I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He replied, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting! Now arise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you as a servant and a witness both of what you have seen and of what I will reveal to you. I will rescue you from the [Jewish] people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, and receive remission of sins as well as an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but I proclaimed this to the people of Damascus first, and Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea. Then I also proclaimed it to the Gentiles—that they should repent, turn to God, and do works worthy of [their] repentance.”"
