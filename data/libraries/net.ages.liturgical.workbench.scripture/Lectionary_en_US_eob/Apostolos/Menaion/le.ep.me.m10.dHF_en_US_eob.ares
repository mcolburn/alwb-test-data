lemeLI.Epistle.text = "Titus, my child, this saying is sure. Concerning these things, I desire that you teach with confidence, so that those who have believed God may be careful to persevere in good works. These things are good and profitable to all. Avoid foolish questions, genealogies, dissensions, and disputes about the law. These things are unprofitable and vain. After a first and second admonition, have nothing more to do with anyone who causes divisions, knowing that such a person is perverted, sinful and self-condemned. When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, do your utmost to meet me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to spend the winter there. Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily and see that they lack nothing. Make sure that our people also learn to maintain good works to meet urgent needs, so that they may not be unfruitful. All who are with me greet you! Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all! Amen."
