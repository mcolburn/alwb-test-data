lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, food does not commend us to God, for if we eat, we are not better; and if we do not eat, we are not worse! However, be careful that your freedom may never become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, will not this person’s conscience, if weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? And thus, through your knowledge, shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ! Therefore, if food causes my brethren to stumble, I will never ever eat meat, so that I may not cause my brethren to stumble. Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least for you I am one! You are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
