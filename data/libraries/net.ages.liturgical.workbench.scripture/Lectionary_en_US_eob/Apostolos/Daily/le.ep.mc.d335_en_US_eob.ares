lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord of glory Jesus Christ with partiality. Yet, if someone with a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your synagogue, and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in, you pay special attention to the one who wears the fine clothing! To the rich you say, “Sit here in a good place,” but you tell the poor man, “Stand over there,” or “Sit here by my footstool!” Have you not shown partiality among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of the world [to be] rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? Yet, you have dishonored the poor! Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you before the courts? Do they not blaspheme the honorable Name by which you are called? However, if you fulfill the royal law found in the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well. But if you discriminate, you commit sin and you are convicted by the law as transgressors. Truly, whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of everything. For he who said, “Do not commit adultery” also said “Do not commit murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. And so, speak and act as people who are going to be judged by a law of freedom. Indeed, judgment is without mercy to those who have shown no mercy, but mercy triumphs over judgment."
