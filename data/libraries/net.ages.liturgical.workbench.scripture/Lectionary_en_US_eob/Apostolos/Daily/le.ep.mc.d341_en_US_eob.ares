lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament, mourn, and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. Do not speak against one another, brethren. Whoever speaks against one of the brethren and judges speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge! Only one is the lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? Now listen, you who say, “Today and tomorrow, we will go into this city, spend a year there, do business, and make a profit.” Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow! Truly, what is your life? It will be a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes away. Instead, you should say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.” Nevertheless, you boast and brag! All such boasting is evil. If someone knows how to do what is good and yet does not do it, it is a sin. Listen, you who are rich: weep and howl for the miseries that are coming on you. Your riches are corrupted and your garments are eaten by moths. Your gold and silver are rusted; their rust will be a testimony against you and it will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up your treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who worked in your fields and which you have kept back by fraud cry out! The cries of those who reaped [for you] have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth. On earth, you have lived in luxury and taken your pleasure. You have eaten to your hearts’ content as in a day of slaughter. You have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one who does not resist you. Therefore, be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rain. You also should be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Brethren, do not grumble against one another, in order not to be judged. Behold, the judge stands at the door!"
