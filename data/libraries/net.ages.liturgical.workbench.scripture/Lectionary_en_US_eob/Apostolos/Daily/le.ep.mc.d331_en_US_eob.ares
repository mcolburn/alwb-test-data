lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, by faith, Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac [in sacrifice]. Yes, he who had joyfully received the promises was now offering up his uniquely loved son, the very one of whom it was said, “In Isaac will your seed be called.” Abraham concluded that God was even able to raise up the dead and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from the dead. By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding future events. By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each one of Joseph’s sons and bowed down, leaning on the top of his staff. By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the exodus of the children of Israel and gave instructions concerning his bones. By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw that he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing to share ill-treatment with God’s people rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time. He considered the disgrace of the Anointed greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt because he had his eyes fixed on the reward. By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, but he persevered as if seeing him who is invisible. By faith, Moses kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on land and when the Egyptians tried to do likewise, they were swallowed up. By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after the people [of the city] had been encircled for seven days. By faith, Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient because she had received the spies in peace."
