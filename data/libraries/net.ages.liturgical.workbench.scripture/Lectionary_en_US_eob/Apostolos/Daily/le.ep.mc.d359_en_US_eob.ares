lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, this is the last hour! As you have heard, the Antichrist is coming and even now many antichrists have arisen. This is how we know that it is the final hour. They went out from us, but they did not belong to us! If they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But [in fact] they left, so that it might be revealed that none of them belonged to us! You have an anointing from the Holy One and you perceive all things. I have not written to you because you do not perceive the truth, but because you perceive it, and because no lie is of the truth. Who is the liar? Is it not anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father. Therefore, what you have heard since the beginning should remain in you. If what you have heard since the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. This is the promise which he promised us: eternal life. I have written to you these things concerning those who would lead you astray. As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as the same anointing teaches you about all things, [his anointing] is true, not a lie. You will remain in him, just as the anointing has taught you. Now, little children, remain in him so that when he appears, we may have boldness and not be ashamed before him when he comes. If you understand that he is righteous, you also understand that everyone who practices righteousness is born of him. Behold, how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called God’s children! For this reason, the world does not understand us, because it did not understand him. Beloved, we are already God’s children, but what we will be is not yet revealed. But when he is revealed, we know that we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is! Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, just as he is pure. Everyone who sins breaks the law, and in fact, sin is lawlessness. You know that Christ was revealed to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin. Whoever remains in him does not continue in sin, but whoever practices sin has not seen him and does not know him. Little children, let no one lead you astray. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. Whoever lives in sin belongs to the devil, since the devil has been a sinner from the beginning. This was the purpose of the manifestation of the Son of God, to undo the work of the devil."
