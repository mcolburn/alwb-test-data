lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? If it were so, the stumbling block of the cross would have been removed. Indeed, I wish that those who disturb you would then emasculate themselves! As for you, brethren, you were called to freedom! Only, do not use your freedom to satisfy the flesh, but through love, become each other’s bondservants because the whole law is fulfilled in one message, which is this one, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour each other, be careful that you do not end up in mutual destruction. I say this: walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh. What the {fallen} flesh desires is against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh! And these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you desire. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious. They are: adultery, sexual immorality, impurity, lust, idolatry, the practice of magic, hatred, strife, selfish ambitions, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies, envies, murders, excess drinking, orgies, and similar things. About these, I warn you, as I have done in the past: those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God."
