Instead, speaking the truth in love, may we grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ. From him, the whole body, being fitted and knit together by what every joint supplies, and according to the participation of each part, grows and builds itself in love. Therefore, I say and testify in the Lord that you [should] no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind."
