In the same way, rejoice, rejoice with me! I hope in the Lord Jesus [that I will be able] to send you Timothy soon, so that I too may be encouraged when I learn how you are doing. For I have no one else with the same soul, who will truly care about you, unlike others who seek their own, not the things of Christ Jesus. But you know how he has proved himself; as a child serves a father, he has served with me to spread the Good News. Therefore, I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how things are going with me [here]."
