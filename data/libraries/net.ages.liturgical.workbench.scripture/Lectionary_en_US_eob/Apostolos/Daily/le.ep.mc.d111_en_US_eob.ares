lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul had passed through the upper country and arrived in Ephesus. And finding some disciples, he asked them, “Did you receive [the] Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit!” Paul asked them, “Then into what were you baptized?” They answered, “Into John’s baptism.” Paul said, “John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus Christ.” After hearing this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in other tongues and prophesied. They were about twelve men in all. Then Paul visited the synagogue and spoke boldly for a period of three months, debating and presenting arguments concerning the Kingdom of God."
