lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you, to the glory of God. Now I say that Christ Jesus was made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God, so that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers, and so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: Therefore, I will give you praise among the Gentiles, O Lord, and sing to your Name. Again he says: Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people. Again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles! Let all the peoples praise him. Again, Isaias (Isaiah) says: There will be the root of Jesse, He who arises to rule over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles will hope. Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy Spirit. I myself am also convinced about you, my brethren, that you are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to instruct one another. But brethren, I write all the more boldly to you, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God, that I should be a servant of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles. I should serve as a priest the Good News of God, so that the offering up of the Gentiles might become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
