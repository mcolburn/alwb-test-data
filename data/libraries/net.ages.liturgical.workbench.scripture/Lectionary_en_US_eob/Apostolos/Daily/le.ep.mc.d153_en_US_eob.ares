lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is a servant of the Church that is at Cenchreae, so that you receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints. Also, may you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you since she has been a benefactor to many, including myself. Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their own lives for my sake. I am grateful to them, and with me all the Churches of the Gentiles. Greet the Church that is in their house and Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ. Greet Mary, who labored much for us. Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and fellow-prisoners who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord. Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved. Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ. Greet those who are of the household of Aristobulus. Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who work hard in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who has labored much in the Lord. Greet Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother, a mother to me as well. Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them. Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. Greet one another with a holy kiss. The Churches of Christ greet you."
