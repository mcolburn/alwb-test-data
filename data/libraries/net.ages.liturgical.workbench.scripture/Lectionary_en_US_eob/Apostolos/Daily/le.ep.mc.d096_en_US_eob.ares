lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter opened his mouth and said, “Truly, I perceive that God does not show favoritism; but in every nation, whoever fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. [God] sent his word to the children of Israel, and the Good News of peace was preached by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all. You know what happened since the Good News was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after baptism was preached by John. You know how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with [the] Holy Spirit and with power, how Jesus went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put him to death, hanging him on a tree, but God raised him up the third day and allowed him to be seen. Yet, he was not manifest to all the people but [only] to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God—that is, to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead. It is to him that all the prophets bear witness: that through his Name, everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.”"
