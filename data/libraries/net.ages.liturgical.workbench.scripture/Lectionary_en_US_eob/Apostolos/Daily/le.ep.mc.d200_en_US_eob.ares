In return, I speak to you as to my children: be open [to what we have to say]. Do not be mismatched with unbelievers: what association is there between righteousness and wickedness? Or what fellowship is there between light and darkness? What agreement does Christ have with Belial? What sharing is there between a believer and an unbeliever? What agreement can there be between Godâ€™s sanctuary and idols? For you are a sanctuary of the living God, even as God said."
