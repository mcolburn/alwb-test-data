lemcLI.Epistle.text = "I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies made earlier which singled you out. By them, may you fight the good fight, keeping the faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and made a shipwreck of the faith, including Hymenaeus and Alexander. I delivered them to Satan so that they might learn not to blaspheme. I desire, therefore, that in every place, the men should pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or doubting. In the same way also, women should wear decent clothing, modest and fitting, without elaborate hairstyle, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing, but with good works, which is fitting for women professing godliness. Let a woman learn in quietness, with all submission. I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to be silent; because Adam was first formed, then Eve. Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, fell into disobedience. However, women will be saved through childbearing, as they remain in faith, love and sanctifying self-restraint."
