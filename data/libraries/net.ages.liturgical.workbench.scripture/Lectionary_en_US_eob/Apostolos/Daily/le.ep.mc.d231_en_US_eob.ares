We should not seek our own good, but each one the other’s good. You may eat whatever is sold at the market, asking no question for the sake of conscience, for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.” If you are invited for a meal by an unbeliever (and if you are inclined to accept), eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience. But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience, for “the earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.”"
