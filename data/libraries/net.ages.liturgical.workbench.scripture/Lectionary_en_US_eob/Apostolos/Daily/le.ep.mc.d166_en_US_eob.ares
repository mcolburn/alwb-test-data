lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let everyone, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God. Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord so as to be trustworthy. I think that it is good (in view of the present distress) for a man to remain as he is. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet, those [who marry] will have tribulations in the flesh, and I want to spare you. Yet, I say this, brethren: the time is short, and from now on, those who have wives should be as though they had none; and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess; and those who use this world, as not using it to the fullest. The reason is that the outward form of this world is fading away. However, I desire that you should be free from [such] cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. But he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife. There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin: the unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman cares about the things of the world, how she may please her husband. I say this for your own benefit; not that I may ensnare you, but [aiming] for what is appropriate, so that you may serve the Lord without distraction."
