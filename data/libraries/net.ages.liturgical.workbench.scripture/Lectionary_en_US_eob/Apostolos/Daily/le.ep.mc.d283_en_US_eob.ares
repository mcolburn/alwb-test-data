Yes, night and day, I pray intensely so that we may see you again and make perfect what is lacking in your faith. Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you. May the Lord grant you to increase and overflow in love for each other and for everyone, even as we also do for you. And may the Lord establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father even to the end, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints."
