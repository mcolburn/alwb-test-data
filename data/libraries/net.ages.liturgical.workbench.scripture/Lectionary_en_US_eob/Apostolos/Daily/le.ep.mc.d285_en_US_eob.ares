lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, comfort one another with these words. But concerning the times and seasons, brethren, you have no need that anything be written to you. You know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night. For when people say, “Peace and safety,” then a sudden destruction will come upon them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape. As for you, brethren, you are not in darkness to allow the day to overtake you like a thief. You are all children of light, and children of the day. We do not belong to the night, or to the darkness. Therefore, let us not sleep as others do, but let us watch and be clear minded. Those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us, so that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
