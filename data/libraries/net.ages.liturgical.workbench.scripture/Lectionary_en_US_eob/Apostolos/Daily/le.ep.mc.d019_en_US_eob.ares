lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Woe to them! They have followed the path of Cain, they have thrown themselves after the error of Balaam for the sake of money, and they have perished in Korah’s rebellion. These people are like hidden and rocky reefs in your agape meals, when they feast with you. They are shepherds who feed themselves without fear, clouds without water carried along by winds, autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted. They are wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved unto the age. About these people, Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied, saying: Behold, the Lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly among them of all their works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. These [people] are grumblers and complainers who pursue their [own] lusts, and their mouth speaks proud things. [They only] show respect to people in order to gain an advantage. As for you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. They said to you that “in the last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.” These [scoffers] are the ones who cause divisions, because they are sensual and deprived of the Spirit. But you, beloved, keep building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit. Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ [that leads] to eternal life. Have compassion on some of them, [but] make a distinction. You can save some of them, snatching them out of the fire with fear, yet hating even the clothing stained by what is carnal. Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling and to present [them] blameless before the presence of his glory in great joy, to God our Savior who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and to all ages. Amen."
