lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we know that if our earthly tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. It is certain that we groan in this [tent], longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling; so that being clothed we will not be found naked. We who are in this tent are truly groaning as we are burdened; but it is not that we desire to be unclothed; rather, we desire to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now the one who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also gave us the pledge of the Spirit. Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by faith, not by sight. I dare say that we are courageous and that we would rather be absent from the body and at home with the Lord. And so, we make this our aim: that whether at home or absent, we would be well-pleasing to him. For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ."
