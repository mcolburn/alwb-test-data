lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, now if Christ is preached and we preach that he has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised! If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is also in vain. Yes, we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified concerning God that he raised up Christ (but if God did not raise him up, then the dead are not raised). Truly, if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised! If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain, and you are still in your sins. Moreover, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If it is only in this life that we have hoped in Christ, we are the most pathetic of all human beings!"
