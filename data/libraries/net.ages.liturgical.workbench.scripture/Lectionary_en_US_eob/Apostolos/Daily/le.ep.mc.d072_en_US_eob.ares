lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away. After entering the city, they went up into the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James [the son] of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas [the brother] of James. With one accord, all these were continuing steadfastly in prayer and supplication, together with certain women, including Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers. In those days, Peter stood up among the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty) and said: “Brethren, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit had spoken beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. For he was numbered with us and received his portion in this ministry. Therefore, of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John and to the day that he was taken up from us, of these [men], one must become a witness with us of his resurrection.” So, they put forward two [candidates]: Joseph called Barsabbas who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away to go to his own place.” And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to the eleven apostles."
