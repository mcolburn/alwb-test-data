lemcLI.Epistle.text = "The presbyter, to the elect lady and to her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all those who know the truth. This is for the sake of truth which remains in us and will be with us forever! Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. I greatly rejoice that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning: we must love one another! This is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should live accordingly. Many deceivers have gone out into the world, people who do not confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. Watch yourselves, so that we may not lose what we have accomplished but receive a full reward. Whoever does not remain in the teaching of Christ but transgresses does not have God; but whoever remains in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive or greet such a person. Whoever welcomes such people participates in their evil works. Even though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete. The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen."
