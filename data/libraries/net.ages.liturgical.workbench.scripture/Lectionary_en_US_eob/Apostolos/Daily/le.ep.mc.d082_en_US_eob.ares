lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, after being released, the apostles came to their own [company] and reported everything that the chief priests and the presbyters had said to them. When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, “O Lord, you who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who by the mouth of your servant, David, said, Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing? The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the Lord, and against his Christ. For truly, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together against your holy child, Jesus, whom you anointed. They did whatever your hand and counsel had foreordained to happen. And now, Lord, consider their threats and grant your bondservants to speak your word with complete boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal, and may signs and wonders be accomplished through the Name of your holy child Jesus.” When they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and proclaimed the word of God with boldness.
