lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we have such confidence through Christ toward God; not that we are competent on our own to claim anything for ourselves; but our competence is from God who has made us competent as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. Indeed, the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life! However, if the ministry of death, written in stones, came with glory, so much that the children of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face (and this glory was passing away): will not the ministry of the Spirit be with much more glory? For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds all the more in glory! It is certain that what used to be glorious has not been made glorious in such a mannerâ€”that is, by such an overwhelming glory. For if what passes away was glorious, how much more glorious is that which remains!"
