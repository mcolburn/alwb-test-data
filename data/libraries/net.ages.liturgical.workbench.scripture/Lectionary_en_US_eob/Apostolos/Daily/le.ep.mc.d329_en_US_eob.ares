lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, be imitators of God, as beloved children. Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God, a sweet-smelling fragrance. But sexual immorality and all forms of impurity and greed should not even be mentioned among you, as is fitting for saints. The same is true regarding filthy and foolish conversations as well as jokes which are not appropriate; instead, give thanks! Know this for sure: no one who is sexually immoral, involved in impurity, greedy, or an idolater has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words; because of these things, the wrath of God is coming on the children of disobedience. Therefore, do not share in their lot. Indeed, you used to be in darkness, but now, you are light in the Lord."
