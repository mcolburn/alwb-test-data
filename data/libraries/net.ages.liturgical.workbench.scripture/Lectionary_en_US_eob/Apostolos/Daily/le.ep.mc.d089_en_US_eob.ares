lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise, and go toward the south, to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.” So Philip arose and went; and behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to express adoration. He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and reading the prophet Isaias (Isaiah). The Spirit said to Philip, “Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.” Philip ran to the eunuch and heard him reading Isaias (Isaiah) the prophet. He asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” The man replied, “How can I, unless someone explains it to me?” He then begged Philip to come up and sit with him. Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. As a lamb before his shearer is silent, so he does not open his mouth. In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away. And who will declare His generation? For his life is taken from the earth. The eunuch asked Philip, “Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about someone else?” Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, he proclaimed {the Good News about} Jesus to this man. As they went on the way, they came to [a place with] some water, and the eunuch said, “Behold, here is water! What is keeping me from being baptized?” He commanded the chariot to stand still, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch did not see him any more and went on his way rejoicing."
