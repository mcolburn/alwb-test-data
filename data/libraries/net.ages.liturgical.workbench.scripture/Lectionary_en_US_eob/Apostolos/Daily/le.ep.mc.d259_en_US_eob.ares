Yes, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we should not trust in ourselves but [only] in God who raises the dead. He who delivered us from such a great death and continued to deliverâ€”we hope that he will also deliver us. You also help by your supplication on our behalf, so that thanksgiving will be offered for the gift bestowed on us by means of many."
