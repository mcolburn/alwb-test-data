lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, pray at all times in [the] spirit with intercessions and requests; never get tired of this and persevere in your requests for all the saints. Pray also for me, so that I may be given an opportunity to proclaim with boldness the mystery of the Good News. For this cause, I am an ambassador in chains; so pray that I may proclaim it boldly, as I should. I also want you to know my affairs, how I am doing. Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything. I have sent him to you for this very purpose, to let you know about our condition and to comfort your hearts. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, even with unfading love. Amen."
