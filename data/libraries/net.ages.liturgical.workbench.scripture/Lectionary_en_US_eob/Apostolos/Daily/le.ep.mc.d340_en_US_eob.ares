lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, does a spring pour forth fresh and salty water from the same opening? My brethren, can a fig tree produce olives, or [can] a vine [produce] figs? Likewise, salt water cannot produce fresh water. Who is wise and understanding among you? Let such a person show by a good conduct that his deeds are done in the gentleness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and do not lie against the truth. This ‘wisdom’ is not the one that comes down from above! It is earthly, sensual, and demonic. Where there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there is confusion and every evil deed. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and hypocrisy. Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. These wars and conflicts among you, where do they come from? Is it not from your desires that wage war in your members? You lust, and do not have! You kill, covet, and [still] cannot obtain! You fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask! You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, in order to spend it for your pleasures. Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility with God? Whoever wants to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God! Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The spirit which dwells in us longs to envy”? But he has given a greater grace, as the Scripture says: God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
