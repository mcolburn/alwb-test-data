lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we are—just as Isaac—children of promise; and it is now as it was then: the one who was born according to the flesh persecuted the one who was born according to the Spirit. So it is even now! However, what does the Scripture say? Throw out the bondmaid and her son, because the son of the bondmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman. And so, brethren, we are not children of a bondmaid, but children of the free woman! Therefore, stand firm in the freedom by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of slavery! Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no profit to you! Yes, once again, I testify to everyone who receives circumcision that he is [now] under duty to accomplish the entire law! You who desire to be justified by the law are no longer under Christ: you have fallen away from grace. As for us, through the Spirit, we wait by faith for the hope of righteousness, since in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value, only faith working through love. You were running so well! Who came to block your way so that you would not obey the truth? This persuasion is not from him who calls you! [Remember], a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough! I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will take no other view; but whoever troubles you will bear his [own] judgment, whoever that [person] may be."
