lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if that first covenant had been without fault, there would have been no place to look for a second one. But finding fault with them, God said: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not continue in my covenant, and I ignored them, says the Lord. This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. They will not [have to ] teach everyone his fellow citizen, and everyone his relative, saying: ‘Know the Lord,’ for all will know me, from their least to their greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness; I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more. By speaking of a new covenant, God has made the first one old. And what is becoming obsolete and aging will soon disappear."
