lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, you are no longer strangers and foreigners! Instead, [you are] fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household, being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ himself is the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord. In him, you too are built up into a dwelling place of God in [the] Spirit. For this reason, I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles! Surely, you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me toward you; how by revelation, he made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in a few words. When you read them, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to anyone as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit. [I mean] that the Gentiles are [now] fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, yes, fellow partakers of God’s promise in Christ through the Good News. Of this Good News, I was made a servant, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given me according to the working of his power."
