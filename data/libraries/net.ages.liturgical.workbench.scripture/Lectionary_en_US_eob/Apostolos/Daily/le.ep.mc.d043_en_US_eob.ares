lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, since we have such a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold on firmly to our confession. Certainly, we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities, but one who has been taught by trial in all things just as we are, yet without sin. Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for assistance in time of need. Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed for their sake in matters pertaining to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for [their] sins. The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray since he himself is also subject to weakness. Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for the sins of the people, as well as for himself. Moreover, nobody assumes this honor by himself but one is called by God, just as Aaron was. Likewise, Christ did not glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was God who said to him: You are my Son: Today I have become your father. As he says also in another place: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
