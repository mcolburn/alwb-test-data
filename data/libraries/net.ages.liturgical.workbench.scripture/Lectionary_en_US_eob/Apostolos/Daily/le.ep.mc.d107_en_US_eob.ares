lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, after passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas arrived in Thessalonica where there was a Jewish synagogue. As was his custom, Paul gave them his attention and for three Sabbath days, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures. He explained and showed that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, saying, “This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.” Some of the Jews were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, together with a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the leading women. But the unconvinced Jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace, gathered a crowd and set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people. But not finding them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city officials, shouting, “These people who have turned the world upside down have also come here, and Jason has received them! All of them act in opposition to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!” The multitude and the city officials were troubled when they heard these things. After receiving a bond from Jason and the others, they let them go."
