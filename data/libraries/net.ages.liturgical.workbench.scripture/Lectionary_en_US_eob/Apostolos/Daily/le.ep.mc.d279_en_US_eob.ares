lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Indeed, brethren, you became imitators of the Churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews. They killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and they drove us out. Their conduct does not please God and makes them the enemies of the entire human race as they want to prevent us from speaking to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved. They are still bringing their sins to full measure, but the wrath is finally coming upon them. Brethren, although we were deprived of your presence for a short time (yet not in affection), we tried even harder to see you face to face with great eagerness. Therefore we wanted to come to you. Certainly, I, Paul, wanted to come again and againâ€”but Satan prevented us. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not you, when our Lord Jesus Christ comes? Truly, you are our glory and our joy!"
