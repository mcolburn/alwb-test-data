Hang on to the eternal life to which you were also called when you made your good profession [of faith] in the sight of many witnesses. Before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who bore witness before Pontius Pilate to this good confession, I charge you to keep the commandment undefiled and blameless until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ which in due time God will reveal. To him who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, alone possessing immortality and dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no one has seen, nor can see: to him be honor and eternal power. Amen."
