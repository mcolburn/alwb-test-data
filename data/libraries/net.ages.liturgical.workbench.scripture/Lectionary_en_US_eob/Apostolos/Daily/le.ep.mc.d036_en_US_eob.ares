lemcLI.Epistle.text = "You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old as a garment, as a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years will not fail. Indeed, to which of the angels did he ever say, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet? Are the angels not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve for the sake of those who will inherit salvation? Therefore, we should pay greater attention to the things that we were taught, for fear that we may drift away. Certainly, if the word spoken through angels proved reliable and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty, how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation! It was first announced by the Lord himself, and it is confirmed to us by those who heard him."
