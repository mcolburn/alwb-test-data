lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a worthless mind, to do those things which are not fitting. They have become filled with all [kinds of] unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, and malice. They are also full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and evil habits. [They are] secret slanderers, backbiters, hateful of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, and unmerciful. Knowing the ordinance of God, (that those who practice such things are worthy of death), they not only do these [very] things but also approve of those who practice them. Therefore, you are without excuse, if you are judging! For in passing judgment on another, you condemn yourself, because you pass judgment and yet practice the same things. We know that the judgment of God is according to truth and against those who practice such things. Do you think that you will escape the judgment of God if you judge those who practice such things and yet act the same? Or do you despise the riches of God’s goodness, tolerance, and patience, not knowing that his goodness leads you to repentance? But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God. He “will pay back to everyone according to their works;” [which is] eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works seek glory, honor, and incorruptibility. However, to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but unrighteousness, there will be retribution and intense wrath, oppression and anguish. Trouble and distress will come to everyone who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
