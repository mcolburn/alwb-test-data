lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brethren, so that you may not claim to be wiser than you are: a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles should come in. And thus all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written: There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins. Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the sake of the forefathers. Indeed, without regret are the gifts and the calling of God! In the past, you were disobedient to God, but now, you have obtained mercy by their disobedience. Likewise, they also have now been disobedient, so that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy. Indeed, God has bound all human beings to disobedience, so that he might have mercy on all. Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and how unfathomable are his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? Or who has first given to the Lord so as to be paid back? Indeed, from him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory unto the ages! Amen."
