lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, locked up to wait for the faith which would later be revealed. Hence, the law was our tutor which was to bring us to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor, and you are all God’s children, through faith in Christ Jesus! For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise. Here is my point: as long as the heir is a child, he is no different than a slave, although being the owner of everything. The heir is under tutors and trustees until the day appointed by the father. Likewise, when we too were children, we were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world. But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, so that he might redeem those who were under the law and so that we might receive adoption as children."
