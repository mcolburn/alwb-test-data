lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were uneducated and untrained men, the Jews were amazed and recognized that these two men had been with Jesus. Seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. But after instructing them to step out of the council, they conferred among themselves, saying, “What shall we do to these men? Indeed, a remarkable miracle has been accomplished through them, as can plainly be seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. Nevertheless, to prevent this from spreading any further among the people, let us severely threaten them so that from now on, they will no longer speak to anyone in this Name.” They called the apostles and ordered them not to speak at all or to teach in the Name of Jesus. But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves! But we cannot help telling the things which we saw and heard!” When they had further threatened the apostles, they let them go. They found no way to punish them on account of the people, because everyone glorified God for what had been done. (Moreover, the man on whom this miracle of healing had been performed was more than forty years old)."
