lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, when you come together, each one of you has a psalm, a teaching, a [saying in a] tongue, a revelation, or an interpretation. Let all these things be done to build each other up. If someone speaks in another tongue, let it be two or at the most three of them, one at a time; and then someone should interpret. But if there is no interpreter, the one who speaks in tongues should remain silent in the Church; and let him speak to himself and to God. Let the prophets speak, two or three of them, and then let the others ponder on what was said. But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, the first speaker should then keep silent. Certainly, all of you can prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and be exhorted. The prophetic spirit is to be under the prophetsâ€™ control, for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As is done in all the Churches of the saints, your women should remain silent in the Churches, for it has not been permitted for them to speak, as they are to be under authority, as the law also says. If they desire to learn about something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is not fitting that women should speak in the Church. Do you think that it was from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone? If any man thinks himself to be a prophet or someone spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you: these are the commandments of the Lord. But the ignorant is truly ignorant! Therefore, brethren, have an intense desire to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues. Let all things be done decently and in order."
