lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong! Let all that you do be done in love. Now I beg you, brethren (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serve the saints), that you also be in service to people like this, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors. I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for what was lacking on your part, they supplied. They refreshed my spirit and yours; show therefore your appreciation to such people. The Churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the Church that is in their house. All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss! This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Maranatha! May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. My love is with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
