lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the Church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and {a} God of all consolation; who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, even so our consolation also overflows through Christ. But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer, and our hope for you is unshaken. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation; knowing that, since you have a share in the sufferings, you also have a share in the consolation."
