lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I wrote to you in my letter to have no fellowship with those who are immoral; yet I did not mean with the immoral people of this world, or with those who are greedy, dishonest, or idolaters; or else you would have to leave the world! But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or greedy, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or someone dishonest. [In fact], do not even eat with such a person! Indeed, what do I have to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are within? But those who are outside, God judges. “Therefore, put away the wicked man from among yourselves!” Now how can any of you dare go to court before the unrighteous (and not before the saints) when there is a matter against a neighbor? Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is [to be] judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, then, things that pertain to this life? And now, if you need to judge things pertaining to this life, why do you place yourselves under judges who are irrelevant in the Church? I say this to move you to shame. Is there not even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers? Yet, [I hear of] lawsuits among the brethren, and that in front of unbelievers! Now therefore, this is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? No, but you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and [you do] that against your brethren! Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor sodomites, nor the greedy, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers, will inherit the Kingdom of God. Some of you used to be like that, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God."
