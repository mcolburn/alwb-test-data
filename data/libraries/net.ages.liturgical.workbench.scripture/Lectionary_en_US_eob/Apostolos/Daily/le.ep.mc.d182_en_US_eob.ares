lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the one who observes the day should observe it ‘to the Lord;’ and the one who does not observe it should do so ‘to the Lord.’ The one who eats should eat ‘to the Lord’ because he gives thanks to God! Likewise, the one who does not eat should do so ‘to the Lord’ because he [also] gives thanks to God! Indeed, we do not live selfishly and we do not die for ourselves. In fact, if we live, we live ‘to the Lord;’ or if we die, we die ‘to the Lord.’ Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. It is for this purpose that Christ died, rose, and lived, so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living."
