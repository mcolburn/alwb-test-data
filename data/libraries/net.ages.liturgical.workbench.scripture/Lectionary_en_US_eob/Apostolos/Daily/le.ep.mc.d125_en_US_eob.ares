lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, when Gentiles who do not have the law do by nature the things of the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law, by showing that the practical expression of the law is written in their hearts. Their conscience bears witness, and their thoughts alternately accuse or defend them. This is for the day when, according to my [proclamation of the] gospel, God, through Jesus Christ, will judge the secret thoughts of all. Indeed, you [who] bear the name of Jew, you rely on the law and glory in God. You know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law. You are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, a corrector of the foolish and a teacher of infants, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. You therefore who teach another, [why] do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one should not steal, [why] do you steal? You who say that a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who glory in the law by your disobedience of the law, [why] do you dishonor God? For “the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” just as it is written. Indeed, circumcision gains something if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. And so, if an uncircumcised man keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? Will not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? For one is not a Jew by being so outwardly, neither is that circumcision [true circumcision] which is outward in the flesh."
