lemcLI.Epistle.text = "James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the Twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings! Consider it as all joy, my brethren, when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. Let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be perfect and whole, lacking in nothing. Yet if any of you lacks wisdom, let such a one ask of God who gives to all abundantly and without finding fault; and it will be given to him. But ask in faith, without any doubting, for whoever doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. Such a person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. This is being double-minded, unstable in every way. Let the brethren of humble circumstances glory in their high position. But the rich should rejoice in being made humble, because like the flower in the grass, they will pass away. Indeed, the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass; its flower falls and the beauty of its appearance perishes. Likewise, the rich shall fade away in their pursuits. Blessed is the one who endures temptation because after being approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love him. When temptations come, let no one say, “I am tempted by God,” because God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one. But a person is tempted when drawn away and enticed by his own lust. Then the lust, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full grown, results in death. Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren! Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there can be no variation or shifting shadow. He brought us forth of his own will by the word of truth, so that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures."
