lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned. Before some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision! Moreover, the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy! When I saw that their behavior was not consistent with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, â€œIf you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do? As for us, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners, yet knowing that no one is justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, we believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law."
