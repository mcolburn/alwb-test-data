lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Beloved, you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example so that you should follow in his steps. Yet he did not sin, “neither was deceit found in his mouth” and when he was cursed, he did not curse back. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed himself to the one who judges righteously. In his body, he bore in himself our sins on the tree, so that having died to sins, we might live to righteousness; and “by his wounds you were healed.” Indeed, you were going astray like sheep, but now, you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls. In the same way, wives, be in subjection to your own husbands. This way, even if they do not obey the word, they will be won by the behavior of their wives without a word, seeing your pure and reverent attitude. Your beauty should not only consist in external ornaments and hairstyles, golden jewelry, or fine clothing. Instead, let it be in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. This is how the holy women of the past hoped in God and also adorned themselves. They were submissive to their own husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him “lord.” You are now her children if you do what is good and do not give in to fear. In the same way, you husbands should live with your wives according to knowledge, giving them honor as to the weaker vessel and also as joint-heirs of the grace of life. This way, your prayers will not be hindered. Finally, all [of you] be like-minded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, polite, not giving back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, give back blessing, knowing that you are called to do this, so that you [yourselves] may inherit a blessing."
