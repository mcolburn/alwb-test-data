lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, by faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing to share ill-treatment with God’s people rather than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time. He considered the disgrace of the Anointed greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt because he had his eyes fixed on the reward. What more shall I say? Time would fail me if I mentioned Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. Through faith, they overpowered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, became strong in weakness, grew mighty in war and caused foreign armies to flee. Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, by chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn apart, they were tempted and they were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep and goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, and ill-treated. And yet the world was not worthy of them! They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth. All of them received a testimony through their faith but they did not receive the promise because God had made provision for us to have something better, and they were not to reach perfection apart from us."
