lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Beloved, the Lord knows how to deliver the godly from temptation and how to hold the wicked for their punishment on the day of judgment, especially those who follow the flesh in a desire for corruption, and have no respect for [angelic] authority. Daring and self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of the glorious ones, whereas angels, although greater in might and power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord. But these people act as natural irrational creatures [that are meant] to be taken and destroyed. They speak evil in matters about which they are ignorant and in their attempt to destroy they will surely be destroyed, receiving the wages of unrighteousness. These are people who consider it pleasurable to revel in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, amusing themselves in their deceit while they {celebrate the agape} feast with you. Their eyes are full of adultery and they cannot break away from sin. They entice unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, and they are children of cursing. They have forsaken the right way and have gone astray by following the path of Balaam the son of Bosor who loved being paid for doing evil. But he was rebuked for his own disobedience: a donkey (with no voice) spoke with a human voice and stopped the madness of the prophet. These people are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved forever. With their high-sounding but empty talk, they entice those who were indeed escaping (from those who live in error in the lusts of the flesh) by [promoting] licentiousness. They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whoever is overcome by something is brought into slavery by what has overcome him. If, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it and overcome [by it], their last state has become worse than the first! It would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, rather than, after knowing it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, “The dog returns to his own vomit” and “the swine that had been washed [has returned] to wallowing in the mire.”"
