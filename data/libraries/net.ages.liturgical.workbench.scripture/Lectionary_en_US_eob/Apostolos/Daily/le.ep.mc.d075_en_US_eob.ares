lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter said to the people, “Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far away, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.” With many other words, he was bearing witness and urging them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!” Then those who gladly received his word were baptized, and about three thousand souls were added on that day. They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to the prayers. Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were accomplished through the apostles."
