Do all things without murmurings and disputes in order to become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you are seen as lights in the world. Uphold the word of life, so that I may have a reason to glory in the day of Christ: that I did not run or labor in vain."
