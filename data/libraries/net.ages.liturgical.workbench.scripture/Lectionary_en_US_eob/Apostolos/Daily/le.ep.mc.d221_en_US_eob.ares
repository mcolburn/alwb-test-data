lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, speaking of a human example: even a human contract, once it has been confirmed, cannot be cancelled or altered. Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. [Notice that] he does not say, “to seeds,” as if there were many, but as of one, “to your seed,” which is Christ. What I am saying is this: the law, which came four hundred thirty years after the covenant previously confirmed by God in Christ, does not cancel it to make the promise of no effect. If the inheritance comes from the law, it is no longer from the promise; but in fact, God granted it to Abraham by way of a promise. What then is the law about? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed to whom the promise had been made should come, and it was established through the angels, by the hand of a mediator. Now there is no mediator when there is only one party, and God is one. Therefore, is the law against God’s [own] promises? Certainly not! If a law had been given which could make alive, then certainly, righteousness would have been from the law. But in fact, the Scriptures declared all things to be captive under sin, so that the promise might be given to those who believe—that is, by faith in Jesus Christ.
