lemcLI.Epistle.text = "About that time, King Herod took actions to oppress some of the [members of the] Church. He had James, the brother of John, killed with the sword. When Herod saw that it pleased the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter as well. (This was during the days of unleavened bread). After arresting Peter, he put him in prison and delivered him to four squads of four soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover. And so, Peter was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the Church to God for him. The same night, when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison. Suddenly, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. Striking Peter on the side, the angel woke him up, saying, “Stand up quickly!” And Peter’s chains fell off from his hands. The angel said to him, “Get dressed and put on your sandals!” and he did so. Then the angel said, “Put on your cloak and follow me!” Peter went out and followed him, but he did not realize that what was being done by the angel was real, thinking that he was seeing a vision. When they were past the first and second guard, they arrived at the iron gate which leads into the city, and it opened to them by itself. Having gone through, they went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. When Peter came to himself, he exclaimed, “Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”"
