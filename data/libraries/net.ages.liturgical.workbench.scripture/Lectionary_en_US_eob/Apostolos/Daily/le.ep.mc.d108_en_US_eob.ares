lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, the Athenians took Paul [by the arm] and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching that you proclaim is all about? You certainly bring some strange things to our ears! Therefore we want to know what all this is about.” Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time doing nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing. So Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, “Athenians! I perceive that you are very religious in all things. In fact, as I passed along and observed your sacred monuments, I also found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an unknown God.’ Therefore, the one you revere in ignorance, this one I announce to you! The God who made the world and all things in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in sanctuaries made with hands! Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all life, breath, and everything else. From one blood, he has made every nation to dwell on the entire surface of the earth (having determined the times and boundaries of their habitation). God did this so that people should seek the Lord and perhaps reach out for him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us. ‘For in him we live, and move, and have our being!’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’ ”"
