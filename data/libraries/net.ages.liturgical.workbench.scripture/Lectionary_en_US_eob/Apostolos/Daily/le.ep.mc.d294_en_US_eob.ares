Amen. I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you in the grace of Christ in order to embrace a different “Good News”—and there is no other “Good News!” Yet, there are some who disturb you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ. Now even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “Good News” that is not what we preached to you, let such a one be accursed! We have said it before and now I say it again: if anyone preaches to you any other “Good News” than what you received, let such a one be accursed! Am I now seeking to please God or people? Am I striving to please human beings? But if I were still trying to please men, then I would not be a bondservant of Christ!"
