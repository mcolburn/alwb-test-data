lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, persevere in prayer, even in vigils of thanksgiving. Pray for us as well, so that God may open to us a door for the word, [an opportunity] to speak the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains. Pray also that I may reveal it as clearly as I should. Live wisely before those who are ‘outside,’ and make the most of your time. Let your speech always be pleasant, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to properly answer those who have questions. All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, a faithful servant and fellow bondservant in the Lord. I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here."
