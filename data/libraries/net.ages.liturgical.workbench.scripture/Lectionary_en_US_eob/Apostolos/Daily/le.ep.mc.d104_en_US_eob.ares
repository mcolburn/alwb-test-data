lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, some believers from the sect of the Pharisees arose and said, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses!” The apostles and the presbyters gathered together to discuss this matter. When there had been much discussion, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brethren, you know that some time ago, God made a choice among us, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News and believe. God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he had done to us. He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. And now, why do you put God to the test by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples, one which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
 But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are.” At this, the whole multitude kept silence. They listened to Barnabas and Paul report what signs and wonders God had accomplished among the nations through them."
