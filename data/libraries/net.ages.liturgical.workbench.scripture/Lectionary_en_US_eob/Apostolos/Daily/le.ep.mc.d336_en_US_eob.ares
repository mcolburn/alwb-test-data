We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and we always pray for you. We have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and about the love which you have for all the saints, because of the hope which is prepared for you in heaven. Of this hope you have heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News which has come to you, even as it is [spreading] in the whole world. It has been bearing fruit and growing [everywhere], as it has done in you too since the day you heard and experienced the grace of God in truth."
