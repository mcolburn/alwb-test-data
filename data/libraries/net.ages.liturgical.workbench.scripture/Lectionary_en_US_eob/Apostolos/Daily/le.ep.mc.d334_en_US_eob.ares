lemcLI.Epistle.text = "My beloved brethren: be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger! Anger does not produce the righteousness of God. Therefore, putting away all [moral] impurity and remains of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word which is able to save your souls. Be doers of the word, not only hearers who delude themselves! Certainly, if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, such a person is like someone looking at his natural face in a mirror. Seeing himself and going away, he immediately forgets what kind of person he was. But whoever looks into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres [in it], not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in doing so. If anyone among you considers himself to be religious but does not bridle his tongue, such a one deceives his heart and his religion is worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their afflictions and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
