lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, for even as we have many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function, likewise we, who are many, are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep! Be of the same mind one toward another. Do not set your mind on exalted things, but associate with the humble. Do not think that you are wiser than you really are. Repay no one evil for evil. Show respect for what is honorable in the sight of all. If it is possible, as much as is in your power, be at peace with all people. Do not seek revenge, beloved, but let God’s wrath follow its course. As it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.” Therefore: If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head. Do not be overcome by evil; instead, overcome evil with good."
