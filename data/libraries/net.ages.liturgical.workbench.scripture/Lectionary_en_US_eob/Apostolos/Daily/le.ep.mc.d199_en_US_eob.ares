lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, Christ died for all, so that those who live should no longer live to themselves but to him who died and rose again for them. Therefore, we do not think of anyone according to the flesh any more. Even though we used to think of Christ according to the flesh, we no longer think of him this way. Therefore, anyone who is in Christ is a new creation! The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new! But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ and who gave to us the ministry of reconciliation. What I mean is that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not imputing sins, but having entrusted us with the word of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors of Christ: it is as if God were making [his] supplication through us: we beg you, on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God! For God made him who knew no sin to become sin for our sake; so that in him, we might become the righteousness of God."
