lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, do you not know what the Scripture says about Elias (Elijah), how he complained to God against Israel, saying, “Lord, they have killed your prophets and broken down your altars! I am left alone, and they seek my life.” But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” Likewise, at this present time, there is also a remnant according to the election of grace. And if [it is] by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.  What then? Israel did not obtain what it was seeking, but the elect obtained it; and the rest were hardened. This is according to what is written: God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, even to this very day. As David says: Let their table become a snare and a trap; a stumbling block; let it be their recompense! Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see, and keep their backs forever bent. I ask then, did they stumble in order to fall? May it never be! However, by their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. Now if their fall is the treasure of the world, and their loss [has become] the riches of the Gentiles; how much greater riches will their fullness bring!"
