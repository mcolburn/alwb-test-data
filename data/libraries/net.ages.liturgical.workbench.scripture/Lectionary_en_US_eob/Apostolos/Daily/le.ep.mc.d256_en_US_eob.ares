lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I trust in the Lord that I too will be able to come shortly. Still, I deemed it necessary to send you Epaphroditus who is my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and the servant of my need. He was longing for you all and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick. Indeed, he was sick, almost to the point of death! But God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but also on me, so that I may not have sorrow upon sorrow. And so, I have sent him all the more eagerly, so that you may rejoice when you see him again, and that I may be less sorrowful. Receive him in the Lord with all joy, and hold such a person in honor, because on account of the work of Christ, he came near to death, risking his life to provide what was lacking in your ministry to me."
