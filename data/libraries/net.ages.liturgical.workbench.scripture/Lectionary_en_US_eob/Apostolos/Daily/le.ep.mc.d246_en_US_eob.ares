lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. Whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Let everyone give according to what he determines in his heart; not grudgingly or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that by having what is needed in everything, you may overflow in every good work. As it is written: He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever. Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food also supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness. Thus, may you be enriched in everything, so that you may be generous in all things; and through us, this brings thanksgiving to God."
