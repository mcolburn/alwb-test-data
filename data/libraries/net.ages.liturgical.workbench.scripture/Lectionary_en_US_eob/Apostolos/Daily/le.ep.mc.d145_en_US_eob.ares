lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I speak to you who are Gentiles: since I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry. May I somehow provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh so that I may save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, if not life from the dead? If the first fruit is holy, so is the whole batch. If the root is holy, so are the branches. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, (having {individually} become partakers with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree), do not boast over the branches! But [even] if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you. You will then say, “Branches were broken off, so that I might be grafted in!” True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand in [your] faith. Do not be full of pride, but fear! Certainly, if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you! You see, then, both the goodness and the severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity [was shown]; but toward you, goodness, [that is], if you continue in his goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off. As for them, if they do not continue in their unbelief, they will be grafted in {again}, because God is able to graft them in again. If you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted against nature into a good olive tree, how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree!"
