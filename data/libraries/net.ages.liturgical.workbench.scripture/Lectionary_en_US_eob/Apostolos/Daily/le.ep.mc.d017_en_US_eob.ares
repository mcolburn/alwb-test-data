lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, sanctified by God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: May mercy, peace and love be multiplied to you! Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I felt it needful to write to you in order to encourage you to fight hard for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. Indeed, there are certain men who have secretly crept in, people whose condemnation was announced long ago. They are ungodly men who turn the grace of our God into indecency, and they deny our only Master and Lord Jesus Christ. Even though you already know this, I wish to remind you that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, later on destroyed those who did not believe! The angels who did not keep their first domain but deserted their own dwelling place, he has also kept in darkness and eternal chains for the judgment of the great day. Likewise, Sodom, Gomorrah, and the cities around them had given themselves over to sexual immorality and unnatural relations in the same way as these angels. They are presented as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire. Yet, these people do the same thing: in their delusion, they degrade the flesh, despise authority, and slander the glorious beings. But the archangel Michael, when he struggled with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring against the devil an evil-speaking judgment, but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!” Yet, these people speak evil of things they know nothing about. What they do understand (by natural power, like the creatures without reason), these things will destroy them."
