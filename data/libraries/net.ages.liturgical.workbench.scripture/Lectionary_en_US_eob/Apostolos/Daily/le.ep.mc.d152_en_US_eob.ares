lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I have my boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God because I will not dare to speak of anything except of what Christ has worked through me. This is for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of God’s Spirit. And so, from Jerusalem, and as far as Illyricum, I have fully preached the Good News of Christ. Yes, I have made it my goal to preach the Good News where Christ was not already called upon, in order not to build on someone else’s foundation. But, as it is written: Those who had no tidings of him will see. Those who have not heard will understand. For this reason, I was hindered many times from coming to you. But now, since I no longer have any place in these regions and since I had for many years a longing to come to you, I [write that I] will come to you whenever I travel to Spain, in order to be helped on my way there by you, and first of all to enjoy your company for a while. But now, I want you to know that I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. It has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem. Yes, it has been their good pleasure, as they are in debt to them. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them to be of service in material things. After I accomplish this and deliver this harvest to them, I will go to Spain by your way. I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ."
