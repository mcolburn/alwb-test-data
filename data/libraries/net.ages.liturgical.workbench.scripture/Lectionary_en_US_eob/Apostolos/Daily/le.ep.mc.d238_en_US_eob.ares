lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, do not be children in thoughts, yet be infants when it comes to evil. Be mature in your thoughts. It is written in the law: By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers, I will speak to this people. Yet, not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord. Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers. Prophesying is [also] a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe. If therefore the whole Church is assembled and all speak in tongues, and someone untaught or unbelieving comes in, will this person not say that you are crazy? But if all prophesy, and if someone who is unbelieving or untaught does come in, that one is convinced and judged by all. Thus, the secrets of that personâ€™s heart will be revealed. And falling down on the face and expressing adoration to God, this person will proclaim that indeed, God is among you."
