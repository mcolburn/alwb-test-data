lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that your consideration for me has blossomed again! (I know that you were thinking about me but lacked the opportunity). I do not want to speak about what I lack, because I have learned to be satisfied with whatever state I am in! I know how to be humbled, and I also know also how to overflow. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret of being both filled and hungry, of being in abundance and in need. I can do all these things through Christ who strengthens me. However, it was a good thing that you shared in my affliction. As you Philippians know as well, in the beginning of the Good News when I departed from Macedonia, no Church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving—only you did! For even [when I was] in Thessalonica you supplied help for my needs once and again. It is not that I seek the gift; what I value is the interest that is accumulating in your account! I actually have all things and I overflow since I received from Epaphroditus what came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and well-pleasing sacrifice to God! My God will supply all of your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. To our God and Father be the glory unto ages of ages! Amen. Greet every saint in Christ Jesus! The brethren who are with me greet you. All the saints greet you, especially those who are of Caesar’s household. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen."
