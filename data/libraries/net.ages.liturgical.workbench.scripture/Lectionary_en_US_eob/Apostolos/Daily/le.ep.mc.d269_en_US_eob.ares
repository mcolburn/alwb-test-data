lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if you died with Christ as regards these basic principles of the world, why do you subject yourselves to [these] commandments, as though you were still living in the world? “Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!” These things are all destined to perish with use! These are merely human commands and teachings! Indeed, these things have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, humility, and severe treatment of the body; but they have no value against the indulgence of the flesh. If you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God! Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
