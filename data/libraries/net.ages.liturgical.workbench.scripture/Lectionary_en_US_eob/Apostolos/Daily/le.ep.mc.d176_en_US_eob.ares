lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, now I beg you, brethren, through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you. Instead, may you be perfected together in the same mind and opinion. As it is, those who are from Chloe’s household have informed me concerning you my brethren, that there are quarrels among you. Now I mean this: that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Kephas,” or, “I follow Christ.” Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one should say that I baptized you into my own name. (I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I do not know whether I baptized any other.) Indeed, Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the Good News—not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void."
