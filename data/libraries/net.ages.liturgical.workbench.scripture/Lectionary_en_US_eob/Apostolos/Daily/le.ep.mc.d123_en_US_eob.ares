lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and unrighteousness of those who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what is known of God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them. For since the creation of the world, his invisible things are clearly seen. They are perceived through created things, even his everlasting power and divinity. This is so that they may be without excuse, because knowing God, they did not glorify him as God or give [him] thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened. Thinking themselves to be wise, they became fools! They exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, of birds, of four-footed animals, and creeping things. Therefore, God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves. Having exchanged the truth of God for a lie, they exalted and offered divine service to the creature rather than the Creator who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions: their women changed the natural function into what is against nature, and the men did likewise. They abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.
