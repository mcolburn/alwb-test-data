lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy: to the Church of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith is growing wonderfully and your mutual love for all is overflowing. Therefore, in the Churches of God, we boast about you for your patience and faith in all your persecutions, and for the afflictions which you endure. This is an obvious sign of the righteous judgment of God, so that you may be accounted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you too suffer. It is righteous for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us. This will be when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, bringing vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus Christ. They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his power, when he comes to be glorified in his holy ones and to be admired among all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that Day."
