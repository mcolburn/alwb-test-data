lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, what is the point of being baptized to be as dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized to be on their side? Why do we also stand in danger at every hour? I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die daily. If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what gain is there for me? If the dead are not raised, then “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” Do not be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.” Wake up to righteousness and do not sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame. But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they return?” You foolish one, even what you sow is not made alive unless it dies first. What you sow, you do not sow [in] the shape that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind. But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own."
