lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of God our Savior, and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope; to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus in order to command certain individuals not to teach a different doctrine or to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These are a cause of disputes rather than Godâ€™s stewardship, which is in faith. The goal of this instruction is love, out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. But some have wandered away from these things, missing the mark and turning to vain discussions. They desire to be teachers of the law, although they do not understand what they are talking about, or what it is that they so strongly affirm."
