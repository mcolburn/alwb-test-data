lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus in order not to spend time in Asia because he was in a hurry: if possible, he wanted to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. From Miletus, Paul sent a message to Ephesus and called to himself the presbyters of the Church. When they arrived, he told them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time. Therefore, keep watch over yourselves and over the flock among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers! Be shepherds of the Church of the Lord and of God, which he has purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you and they will not spare the flock. From among your own group, men will arise who will speak perverse things in order to draw away the disciples after them. Therefore, keep watch! Remember that for a period of three years, I did not cease night and day to warn everyone with tears. Now, brethren, I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace which is able to build [you] up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. I coveted no one’s silver, or gold, or clothing. You yourselves know that these, [my] hands, served my needs and those who were with me. In all things, I have given you an example, that by this kind of hard work you should support the weak and remember the word of the Lord Jesus, as he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive!’” After saying these things, Paul knelt down and prayed with them all."
