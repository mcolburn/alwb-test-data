lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we [do] speak wisdom among those who are full grown; yet it is a wisdom ‘not of this world,’ nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing. Instead, we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that was hidden, which God had foreordained before the ages for our glory, [a wisdom] which none of the rulers of this world recognized. For if they had recognized this wisdom, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory! But as it is written: Things which an eye did not see, and an ear did not hear, which did not enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him."
