lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, since we are receiving a Kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be grateful and so offer divine service to God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire. Continue loving each other as brethren. Do not forget to be hospitable to strangers, for in doing so, some have welcomed angels without knowing it! Remember those who are in chains, as if chained with them, and also those who are ill-treated, as if you too were suffering in the body. Marriage must be held in honor among all and the [marriage] bed [kept] undefiled: but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers. Be free from the love of money and be satisfied with what you have. As God has said: I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you. And so, we say with good courage: The Lord is my helper, I will not fear. What can man do to me? Remember your leaders, those men who proclaimed the word of God to you. Considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
