lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren,putting away what is false, speak the truth to each other, for we are members of one another. “Be angry, and do not sin.” Do not let the sun go down on your anger and do not leave any room for the devil. Those who used to steal should steal no more, but rather work hard, even with their own hands to do what is good, so that they may have something to give to those who have need. Do not allow any decadent speech to come out from your mouth, [but] only what is good to build up as is needed, in a way that gives grace to those who hear. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by which you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, shouting, and slander be put away from you, along with evil thoughts. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other just as God also forgave us in Christ."
