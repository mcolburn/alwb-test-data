lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I do not nullify the grace of God! For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!” Senseless Galatians! Christ was openly presented before your eyes as crucified—who then bewitched you not to obey the truth? I just want to hear this from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard? Are you that senseless that having begun in the Spirit, you now end in the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness,” know, therefore, that those who are of faith are likewise Abraham’s children."
