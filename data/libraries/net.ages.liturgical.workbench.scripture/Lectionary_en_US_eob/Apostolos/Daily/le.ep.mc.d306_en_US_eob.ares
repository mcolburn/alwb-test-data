lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, instruct those who are rich in this present world that they should not be proud or place their hope on uncertain riches but on the living God who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Teach them to do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute and willing to share. In this way they will store up for themselves a good foundation for the future and take hold of eternal life. Timothy, guard what has been committed to you! Turn away from worldly and empty discussions as well as from the contradiction of the falsely so-called knowledge. Those who have embraced this have wandered from the faith! Grace be with you! Amen."
