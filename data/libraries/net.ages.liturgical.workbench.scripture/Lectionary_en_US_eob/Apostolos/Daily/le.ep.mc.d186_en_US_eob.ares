lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if it is appropriate for me to go also, they will accompany me. But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, since I have to go through Macedonia. I may also stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my journey. Truly, I do not wish to see you only in passing, but I hope to stay with you for a while, if the Lord permits. But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost, because a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. Now if Timothy comes, make sure that he has nothing to fear from you, for he does the work of the Lord as I do. Therefore, let no one despise him, but set him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers. Now concerning Apollos, the brother: I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; but it was not his desire to come now. He will come when he has an opportunity."
