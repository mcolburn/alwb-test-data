lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions, “if he comes to you, receive him”), and also Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God who are of the circumcision, and they have been my consolation. Epaphras (who is one of you), a bondservant of Christ, salutes you. He is always wrestling for you in his prayers, so that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. I can testify about him: that he has devotion to you, and also to those in Laodicea and Hierapolis. Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you. Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea; and also Nymphas, along with the Church which meets in his house. When this letter has been read among you, please have it also read in the Church of the Laodiceans; and also read the letter from Laodicea. Tell Archippus this: “Be mindful of the ministry which you have received in the Lord, and fulfill it.” Here is my greeting: Paul, with my own hand! Remember my chains. Grace be with you! Amen."
