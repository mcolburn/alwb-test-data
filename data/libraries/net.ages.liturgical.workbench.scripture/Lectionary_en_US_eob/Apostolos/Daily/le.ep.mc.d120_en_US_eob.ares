lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Now when the day of Pentecost came, they were all with one accord [gathered] in the same place. Suddenly, there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Divided tongues that seemed like fire appeared and one [tongue] rested on each of them. Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak. At that time {of year}, devout Jews from every nation under heaven were staying in Jerusalem. When this sound was heard, a crowd formed and people were bewildered because everyone heard the disciples speaking in his own language. They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans? How is it that we hear everyone [speak] in our own native language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages [concerning] the deeds of power of God!”"
