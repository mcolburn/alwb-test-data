lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, bear each othersâ€™ burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ. If anyone thinks that he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. But let everyone test his own work: then one can take pride in himself, not by comparison with someone else. Yes, each one will bear his own burden, but everyone who is being taught in the word should share all good things with the one who teaches. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked; whatever someone sows is what he will reap. Whoever sows to [the field of] self-indulgence will reap corruption from the flesh. But the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. Let us not grow tired of doing what is good, for we will reap in due season, if we do not give up. And so, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who belong to the household of the faith."
