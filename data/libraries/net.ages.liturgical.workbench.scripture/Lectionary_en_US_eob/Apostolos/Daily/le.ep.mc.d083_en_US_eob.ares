lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, a certain man named Ananias, along with his wife Sapphira, [also] sold a possession. He kept back part of the price (of which his wife was also aware) and brought the rest, laying it at the apostles’ feet. But Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled your heart so as to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land? As long as you kept it, was it not still your own? And after it was sold, was it not [still] in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God!” Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell to the ground and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things. The young men got up, wrapped him, and carried him out to be buried. About three hours later, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in. Peter asked her, “Tell me, was this the price you sold the land for?” She answered, “Yes, for that price.” Then Peter said to her, “How is it that you have conspired to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!” At once, she fell down at Peter’s feet and died. The young men came in and found her dead; they carried her out and buried her next to her husband. Great fear came on the whole Church and on all who heard these things."
