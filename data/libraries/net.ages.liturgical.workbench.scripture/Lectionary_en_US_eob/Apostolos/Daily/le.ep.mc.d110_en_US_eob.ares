lemcLI.Epistle.text = "The first book I wrote, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning, until the day in which he was taken up, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. After he suffered, he also presented himself alive to them by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God’s Kingdom. Being assembled together with them, he commanded them, “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me. Indeed, John baptized in water, but not many days from now, you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.” Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?” Jesus told them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons which the Father has set by his own authority. However, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” After saying these things, as they were watching, Jesus was taken up and a cloud took him out of their sight. While they were gazing into the sky as he was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood by them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into the sky? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into heaven.” Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away."
