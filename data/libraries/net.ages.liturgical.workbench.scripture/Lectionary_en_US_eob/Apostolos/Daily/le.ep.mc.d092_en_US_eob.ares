lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, as Peter was traveling through all those regions, he also came down to [visit] the saints who lived in Lydda. There, he found a certain man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and who had been bedridden for eight years. Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and make your bed!” And immediately, he arose. All who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. Now there lived in Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, (which, when translated means Gazelle). This woman was full of good works and acts of mercy. But it happened that at this time, she became ill and died. She was washed and placed in an upper room. As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to help them. So Peter arose and went with them. When he arrived, the disciples led him into the upper room. All the widows stood by him weeping, showing [Peter] the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. But having put everyone out [of the room], Peter knelt down and began to pray. Turning toward the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. Then Peter gave her his hand and raised her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord."
