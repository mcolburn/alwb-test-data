You were dead in transgressions and sins, and this was your lifestyle according to the age of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience. We used to live among them and we used to live in self-indulgence, doing the desires of the {fallen} flesh and mind, and we were by nature children of wrath, just as the others."
