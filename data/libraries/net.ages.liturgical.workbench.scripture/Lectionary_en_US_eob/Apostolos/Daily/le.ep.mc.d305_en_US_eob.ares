lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, do not lay your hands hastily on anyone and do not be a participant in someone else’s sins. Keep yourself pure. Do not drink only water but use a little wine for your stomach and because of your frequent illnesses. The sins of some people are obvious long before they come to judgment while others are discovered only later. Likewise, good works are obvious, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden. Those who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of all honor, so that God’s Name and our doctrine may not be brought into disrepute. Slaves whose masters are believers should not despise them, because they are brethren. Rather, they should serve them because those who have a share in the benefit [of their work] are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things. If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the doctrine of godliness, such a person is conceited, ignorant, and obsessed with arguments, controversies, and disputes over words. These things result in envy, conflict, insults, evil suspicions, and useless disputes between people whose minds are corrupt and devoid of truth—people who treat religion as a means of gain. Godliness, in fact, brings great gain if one is content. Indeed, we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly cannot carry anything out! But if we have food and clothing, let us be content with that. Those who are determined to become rich fall into a temptation and a snare with many senseless and harmful lusts which plunge them into ruin and destruction. Truly, the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed and they have pierced themselves with many sorrows. But you, man of God, flee these things!"
