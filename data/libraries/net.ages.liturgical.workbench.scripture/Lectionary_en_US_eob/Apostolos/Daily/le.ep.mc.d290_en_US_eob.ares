With this in mind, we also pray always for you, so that our God may account you worthy of your calling and fulfill with power [your] every desire of goodness and work of faith. May the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering to him, we ask you not to be quickly shaken in your mind. Do not be troubled by a prophecy, report, or letter allegedly from us, saying that the day of Christ has come."
