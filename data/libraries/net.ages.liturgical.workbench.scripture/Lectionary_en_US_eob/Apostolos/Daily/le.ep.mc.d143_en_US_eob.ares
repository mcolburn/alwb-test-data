lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.” Indeed, there is no distinction between Jew and Greek because the same Lord is Lord of all, and he is generous to all who call on him. For, “Whoever will call on the Name of the Lord will be saved.” But how will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher? And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things! Still, they did not all listen to the Good News. As Isaias (Isaiah) says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” And so, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. But I say, did they not hear? Yes, most certainly: Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. But I ask, did not Israel know? First, Moses says: I will provoke you to jealousy with what is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry. Isaias (Isaiah) is very bold and says: I was found by those who did not seek me. I was revealed to those who did not ask for me. Yet, regarding Israel, he says: All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and opposing people. I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! In fact, I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God did not reject his people, which he foreknew."
