lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I say this for your own benefit; not that I may ensnare you, but [aiming] for what is appropriate, so that you may serve the Lord without distraction. Nevertheless, if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she has past the flower of her age, and if it is required, let him do what he wills. He does not sin; let them marry. As for the one who stands steadfast in his heart, (having no necessity, but having control over his own will to keep his virginity): he does well. And so, he who marries [his betrothed] does well, but he who does not does better. A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, [but] only in the Lord. In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is, and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love builds up. But anyone who thinks that he knows anything does not yet know as he should know. On the other hand, if anyone loves God, such a person is known by him. Therefore, concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. Indeed, although there are [many] things called “gods” in the heavens or on earth—and there are many [so-called] “gods” and many “lords”—yet, to us, there is one God the Father, from whom are all things; and we [are] for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things, and we live through him. However, such knowledge is not found in everyone. There are some who eat things sacrificed to an idol with awareness of the idol, and their conscience (being weak) is defiled."
