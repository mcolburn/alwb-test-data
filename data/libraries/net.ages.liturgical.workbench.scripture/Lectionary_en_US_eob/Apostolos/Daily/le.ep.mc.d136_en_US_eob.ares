lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. Indeed, I do not know what I am doing! I do not practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, this is what I do! But if I do what I do not desire, I agree that the law is good. And so, I am no longer the one doing this [evil], but [it is] the sin which dwells in me! Thus, I know that in me, (that is, in my flesh), nothing good dwells, because although [the power of] will is present within me, I do not find it doing what is good. In fact, the good which I desire, I do not do; but the evil which I do not desire, this is what I do! But if I do what I do not desire, I am no longer the one doing it, but [it is] the sin which dwells in me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, it is evil that is present. For I delight in God’s law in my inmost self, but I see a different law [working] in my members, and it is at war against the law of my mind! It brings me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members. Miserable one that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! And so, with the mind I serve God’s law, but with the flesh, [I serve] the law of sin. Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and of death."
