First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world. Surely, God (to whom I offer divine service in my spirit in the Good News of his Son) is my witness, how unceasingly I always make mention of you in my prayers. I request, if by any means now at last I may be blessed by the will of God to come to you. For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift with the purpose that you may be established; that is, that I may be encouraged together with you, each of us by the otherâ€™s faith, both yours and mine."
