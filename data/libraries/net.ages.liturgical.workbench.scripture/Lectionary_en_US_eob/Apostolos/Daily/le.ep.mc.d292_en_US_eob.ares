lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we must always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. Indeed, he called you through our Good News to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. And so, brethren, stand firm and keep the traditions which we taught you, whether by word or by letter. May our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal consolation and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work. As for other matters, brethren, pray for us, so that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it is with you. Pray also that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men, for not all have faith. Still, the Lord is faithful; he will establish you and guard you from the evil one. We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both accomplish and will continue to accomplish the things which we command you. May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the endurance of Christ."
