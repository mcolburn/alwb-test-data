lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I do not consider myself inferior to the superlative apostles: although I am unskilled in speech, I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way, what we are has been revealed to you in all [these] things. Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God’s Good News to you free of charge? I ‘robbed’ other Churches, taking wages from them, so that I might serve you! When I was present with you and found myself in need, I was not a burden on anyone because when the brothers came from Macedonia, they provided according to my need. In everything, I have refrained from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do so. As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia. Why do I say this? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do! But what I do, I will keep doing, in order that those who wish to boast as we do may have no such occasion. As it is, such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, trying to pass themselves off as Christ’s apostles. And this is no wonder: even Satan presents himself as an angel of light. It is no great thing, then, if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, and their end will be according to their works. I say it again: may you not think that I am fool! But if you do, receive me still as foolish, so that I also may boast a little. What I [now] speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting. And since I see that many boast as humans do, I will also boast. Yes, since you are wise, you bear with the foolish gladly! In fact, you put up with someone who brings you into slavery, devours you, takes you captive, exalts himself, or strikes you on the face. I say this to our shame: we were too weak for that!"
