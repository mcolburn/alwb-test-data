lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, there was a certain man in Caesarea whose name was Cornelius. He was a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment, a devout man who feared God with his entire household. He gave generous alms to the people and always prayed to God. At about the ninth hour of the day, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him, and saying to him, “Cornelius!” Gazing at the angel and being quite alarmed, Cornelius said, “What is it, Lord?” The angel replied, “Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God. Now send men to Joppa, and get Simon who is called Peter. He is staying with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.” When the angel who had spoken to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among his attendants. Having explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. Now on the next day, as they were on their way and approached the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray at about the sixth hour. He became hungry and desired to eat, but while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. He saw heaven opened and something like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky. Then a voice came to him, “Rise, Peter, kill and eat!” But Peter said, “Not so, Lord! I have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean!” Again, a second time, the voice spoke to him, “What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean.” This happened three times, and again the vessel was taken up into heaven."
