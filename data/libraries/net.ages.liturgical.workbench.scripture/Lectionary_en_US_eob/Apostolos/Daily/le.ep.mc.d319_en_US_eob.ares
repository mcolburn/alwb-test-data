lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we have much to say about Melchizedek but it is hard to explain because you have become slow at understanding. For although by this time you should be teachers, you still need to have someone teach you [even] the basic principles of God’s oracles. You have come to need milk, and not solid food! Everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness; such a person is a baby. But solid food is for those who are fully grown, who have trained their senses to discern good and evil. Therefore, going beyond the teaching of the basic principles about Christ, let us move on to perfection! Let us not lay again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God, of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. If God allows, let us do this. Regarding those who were once enlightened, who tasted of the heavenly gift, became partakers of the Holy Spirit, tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, but then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance! They crucify the Son of God for themselves all over again and expose him to shame! On the other hand, the land which has absorbed the rain that comes often upon it and thus brings forth a crop suitable for those who till it—such a land receives blessing from God. Yet if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected, close to being cursed; and its end is to be burned."
