lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and who reveals through us the sweet fragrance of his knowledge in every place. Indeed, we are a sweet fragrance of Christ to God, both in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing. To the latter, we are a stench of death to death, but to the first [we are] a sweet fragrance of life to life. Who is equal to such a task? We are not as others who ‘peddle the word of God,’ but we speak in Christ with sincerity, as from God and in the sight of God. Are we again trying to obtain your approval? Or do we need (as some do) letters of recommendation to you or from you? You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all! It is being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, and not in tablets of stone but in tablets that are hearts of flesh."
