lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, Moses indeed was a faithful servant in all of God’s house, as a testimony for what would later on be spoken about. But Christ is faithful as a Son over his [own] house, and we are his house, if we firmly hold on to the confidence and pride of our hope until the end. Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says: Today if you will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, as in the day of the trial in the wilderness, where your fathers tested me, tried me, and saw my works for forty years. Therefore, I was displeased with that generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart, they did not know my ways’; as I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not enter into my rest.’ With whom was God displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? Was it not to those who were disobedient? We see that they were not able to enter in because of [their] lack of faith."
