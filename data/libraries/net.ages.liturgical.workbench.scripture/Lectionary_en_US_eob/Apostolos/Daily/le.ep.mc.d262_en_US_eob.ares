lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and we always pray for you. This is what you also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bondservant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf. He has informed us of your love in [the] Spirit. For this reason, since the day we heard this, we do not cease praying and making requests for you, so that you may be filled with the knowledge of Godâ€™s will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding. We also pray that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. May you be strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, [to be prepared] for all [kinds of] endurance and perseverance with joy!"
