lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, God has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires. You will then ask me, “Why does God still find fault? Who can resist his will?” But who indeed are you, a human being, to argue with God? Will the thing formed ask the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?” Does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor? What if God, willing to show his wrath and also to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath fitted for destruction; and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory? That is us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? As he says also in Hosea: I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people; and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved. It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ There they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ Isaias (Isaiah) cries concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved; for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the Lord will make a short work upon the earth. As Isaias (Isaiah) has said before: If the Lord of Hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah. What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, [still] attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not in fact arrive at the law of righteousness. Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but by the works of the law! For they stumbled over the stumbling stone, even as it is written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be disappointed."
