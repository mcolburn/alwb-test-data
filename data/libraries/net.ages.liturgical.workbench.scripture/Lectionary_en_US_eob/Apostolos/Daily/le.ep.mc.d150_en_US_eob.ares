lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, it is for this purpose that Christ died, rose, and lived, so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living. But [as for] you, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. As it is written: ‘As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow to me; every tongue will confess to God.’ And so, each of us will give a personal account to God. Therefore, let us not judge one another any more. Instead, resolve that no one should put a stumbling block in his brother’s way, or an occasion for falling. In the Lord Jesus, I know and I am convinced that nothing is unclean of itself. But to the one who considers anything to be unclean, to such a one it is unclean! Yet, if because of food your brother is grieved, you no longer walk in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died. Thus, do not let what is good to you become a cause of evil things being said, because the Kingdom of God is not [about] eating and drinking, but [it is about] righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Certainly, whoever serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by all."
