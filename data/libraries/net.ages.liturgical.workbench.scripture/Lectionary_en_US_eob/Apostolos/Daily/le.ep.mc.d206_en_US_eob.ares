lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, thanks be to God who puts into Titusâ€™ heart the same devotion for you. He has accepted our exhortation, but since he was very eager, he [actually] went out to you of his own accord. We have sent along with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known in all the Churches. In fact, he was also appointed by the Churches to accompany us with this grace, which we administer to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our zeal. There is one thing that we want to avoid: that anyone should blame us about this general gift which we administer. We endeavor to act honorably, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. We have sent with them our brother who has proven his eagerness in many ways, but now he is even more eager because of his great confidence in you. Regarding Titus: he is my partner and fellow worker for your sake. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the Churches, the glory of Christ. Therefore, demonstrate your love to them before the Churches; show that we were right to boast about you to them. It is not necessary that I should write to you about the ministry to the saints. Indeed, I know that you are ready and I boast about you to the Macedonians, that you in Achaia have been ready since last year. Your zeal has encouraged very many of them! But I have sent the brothers, so that our boasting about you may not be in vain in this respect: as I have said, be prepared. Otherwise, if anyone from Macedonia comes with us and finds you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) would be disappointed in this confident boasting [about you]. Therefore, I thought it necessary to ask the brothers to reach you first in order to arrange ahead of time the generous gift which you promised before. Thus, may the gift be ready as a matter of generosity, not greediness."
