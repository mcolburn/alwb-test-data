lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, man is not from woman, but woman from man; for man was not created for the woman, but woman for the man. For this cause, a woman should have [a sign of] authority on her head, because of the angels. Nevertheless, in the Lord, a man is not independent from the woman, nor a woman independent from the man. For as woman came from man, so a man also comes [to life] through a woman; but all things are from God. Judge for yourselves: is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled? Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her hair is given to her as a covering. But if anyone wishes to dispute these things, we have no other custom, and neither do God’s Churches. Yet, in giving you this instruction, I do not praise you, as you come together not for the better but for the worse. First of all, when you come together as Church, I hear that divisions take place among you, and I partly believe it. Indeed, there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be revealed among you. As it is, when you gather together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat, because each one takes his own supper first! One is hungry, and another is drunk! Do you not have houses where you can eat and drink? Or do you despise God’s Church and put to shame those who have nothing? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this, I do not praise you. For I received from the Lord what also I delivered to you."
