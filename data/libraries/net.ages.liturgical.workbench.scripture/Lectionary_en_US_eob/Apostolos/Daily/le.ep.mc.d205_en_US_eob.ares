lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, as you overflow in everything: faith, speech, knowledge, devotion, and [also] in your love for us, try to overflow even in this grace {of generous giving}. I am not saying this as an order, but as testing your love by mentioning the devotion of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: even though he was rich, yet he became poor for your sake, so that by his poverty you might become rich. I give my opinion in this matter: it would be the right thing to do for you, since a year ago you were the first to do something (and this was also your will), to complete what you were doing. Just as there was the readiness to be willing, may there [also] be completion {of this project} according to your means. If you are ready, the gift is acceptable according to what one has—not according to what one does not have. The goal is not that others may have it easy and that you would be in distress; this is about a balancing out. In this present time, let your abundance make up for what others lack, so that their abundance also may become a supply for what you lack—that there may be equality. As it is written, “The one who gathered much had nothing left over, but the one who gathered little was not in need.”"
