lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, so that we may bring [our] holiness to completion in the fear of God. Open your hearts to us! We wronged no one, we corrupted no one, and we took advantage of no one. I say this not to condemn you, for as I have said before, you are in our hearts to die together and to live together. [But] great is my boldness of speech toward you; great is my boasting on your behalf! I am filled with consolation; I overflow with joy in all our afflictions. Indeed, even after arriving in Macedonia, our flesh had no relief; we were afflicted on every side. There was struggle on the outside and fear inside. Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us with the arrival of Titus; and not just by his arrival but also by the encouragement he had received from you. He told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; and I rejoiced even more. Although I [know that I] made you feel bad with my [first] letter, I do not regret it (though I did regret it for a while), for I can see that my letter made you sorry, at least for a while. But now I rejoice, not that you experienced distress, but that you were made sorry to [the point of] repentance. Indeed, you experienced godly distress and thus you did not experience a loss because of us. Indeed, godly sorrow works repentance that leads to salvation; it does not bring regret. On the other hand, the sorrow of the world is deadly."
