lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, to the one who works, the reward is not considered as a grace but as something owed. But to the one who does not work but believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, it is faith that is accounted for righteousness. Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God attributes righteousness apart from works: Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin. Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised {only}, or on the uncircumcised as well? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham as righteousness. How then was faith taken into account? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised! He received the sign of circumcision, (a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was still uncircumcised), so that he might be the father of all those who believe, even if they are uncircumcised, so that righteousness might also be accounted to them. He is the father of circumcision not only to those who are of the circumcision, but [to those] who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had before he was circumcised."
