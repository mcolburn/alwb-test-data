lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, looking straight at the Sanhedrin, Paul said, “Brothers, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.” Then Ananias, the high priest, ordered those who stood by him to strike Paul on the mouth. At this, Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and [yet] command me to be struck contrary to the law?” Those who stood by said, “Do you insult God’s high priest?” Paul said, “I did not know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’” But when Paul realized that some were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! And I am being judged concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead!” When he said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. (For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, angel, or spirit; but the Pharisees believe in all of these things). A great uproar began, and the teachers of the law who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up. They strongly argued, “We find no evil in this man! But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God!” The dispute became so fierce that the commanding officer feared that they would tear Paul to pieces. He then ordered the soldiers to go down and remove Paul from the assembly by force, and to bring him into the barracks. The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said, “Rejoice, Paul! As you have borne witness to me in Jerusalem, you must also bear witness in Rome.”"
