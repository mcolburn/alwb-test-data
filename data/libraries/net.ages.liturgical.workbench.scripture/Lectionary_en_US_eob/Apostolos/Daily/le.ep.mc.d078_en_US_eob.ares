lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, many signs and wonders were accomplished among the people by the hands of the apostles, and they were all [gathered] with one accord in Solomon’s porch. No one else dared to join them, even though they were honored by the people. More believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women. People even carried out the sick into the streets, placing them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them. Crowds also formed from the cities around Jerusalem; they brought sick people, as well as those tormented by unclean spirits, and all were healed. However, the high priest took action, along with all his associates (which is the sect of the Sadducees). Filled with jealousy, they laid their hands on the apostles and placed them in the public jail. But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night and brought them out, saying, “Go, stand in the temple, and speak to the people the whole message about this life.”"
