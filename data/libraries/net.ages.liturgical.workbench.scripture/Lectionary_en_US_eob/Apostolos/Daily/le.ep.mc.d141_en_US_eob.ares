lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we rejoice in hope of the glory of God! Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. Indeed, one will hardly die for someone righteous, but perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die. But God entrusts his own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Even more so then, since we are now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him! For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more shall we be saved by his life!"
