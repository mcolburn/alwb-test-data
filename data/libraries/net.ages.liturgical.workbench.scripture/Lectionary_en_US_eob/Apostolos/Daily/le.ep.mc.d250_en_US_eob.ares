lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I will not be put to shame in any way, but as I speak with all boldness, Christ will be exalted now as always in my body, whether by my life or by my death. For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. But if I remain alive in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work. Yet, I do not know what I will choose! I am in a dilemma between the two, having the desire to be released and be with Christ, which is far better. At the same time, to remain in the flesh is a more urgent need for your sake. Having this confidence, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in faith, so that your rejoicing may overflow in Christ Jesus when I am with you again. [In the meantime], let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I may hear this about your condition: that you stand firm in one spirit, striving with one soul for the faith of the Good News."
