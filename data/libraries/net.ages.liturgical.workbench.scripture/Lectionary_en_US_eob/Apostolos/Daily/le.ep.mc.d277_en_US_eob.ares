lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, you certainly know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in vain! Having suffered before and having been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know, we became bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in a context of much conflict. Certainly, our exhortation does not come from error, impurity, or deception. But since we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News, this is how we speak, not to please people, but God who tests our hearts. We never used flattering words, as you know, and we never put a mask over greed (as God is witness). We did not seek glory from men (neither from you nor from others), even though we could have claimed authority as apostles of Christ. Instead, we were gentle among you, as a nursing mother cherishes her own children. We became so devoted to you that we were pleased to share not only the Good News of God but also our very souls, because you had become very dear to us."
