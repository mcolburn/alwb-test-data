lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, Christ is our peace, he who made both [groups to be] one and tore down the wall of separation. He abolished in his flesh the enmity which is the law of commandments with its decrees, so that he might create in himself one new humanity instead of two, making peace. He reconciled both [groups] to God in one body, through the cross, by which he destroyed that enmity. He came and preached peace to you who were far off and also to those who were near. Through him, we both have access to the Father in one Spirit. And so, you are no longer strangers and foreigners! Instead, [you are] fellow citizens with the saints, and members of Godâ€™s household, being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ himself is the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy sanctuary in the Lord. In him, you too are built up into a dwelling place of God in [the] Spirit."
