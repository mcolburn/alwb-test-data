lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, full of faith and power, Stephen performed great wonders and signs among the people. But some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), along with Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia, reacted. They began debating with Stephen, but they were not able to withstand the wisdom and spirit by which he spoke. Then they secretly convinced [some] men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God!” Having stirred up the people, the presbyters and the scribes came against Stephen and arrested him. They brought him before the Sanhedrin and produced false witnesses who said, “This man is always uttering blasphemies against the holy place and [against] the law. We have even heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us!” All the members of the council gazed at Stephen and saw that his face was like the face of an angel. The high priest asked, “Are these things so?” Stephen answered, “Brothers and fathers, hear me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was [still] in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. And God said to him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.’ This is how Abraham came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead, God moved him into this land, where you are now living. He gave Abraham no inheritance in this land, no, not so much as to set his foot on it. But God had promised that he and his descendants would possess this land, even when Abraham was still childless. Yet, it was Solomon who built him a house. However, the Most High does not dwell in sanctuaries made with hands, as the prophet says: ‘Heaven is my throne, and the earth is a footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me?’ says the Lord; ‘or what is the place of my rest?’ Did not my hand make all these things? You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your fathers did, you do likewise. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? They [even] killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers. You received the law as it was ordained by angels, and did not keep it!” Now when they heard these things, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. He exclaimed, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” At this, they shouted with a loud voice, blocking their ears, and rushed at him with one accord. So they threw him out of the city and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. As they were stoning Stephen, he called in prayer, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” Kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” Having said this, he fell asleep.
