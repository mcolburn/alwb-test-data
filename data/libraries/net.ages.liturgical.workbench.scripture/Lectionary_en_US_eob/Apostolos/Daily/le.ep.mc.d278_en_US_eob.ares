lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Remember, brethren, our labor and hardship: we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you as we preached to you the Good News of God. You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe. As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own children, with the purpose that you should live worthily of God who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory. For this reason, we also thank God without ceasing that when you received from us the word of Godâ€™s message, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth: the word of God. And it is at work in you who believe! Indeed, brethren, you became imitators of the Churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews."
