lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, walk as children of light, for the fruit of the Spirit is in all [manner of] goodness, righteousness and truth. Discern what is well-pleasing to the Lord! Have no fellowship with the vain works of darkness, but rather, expose them for what they are. It is a shame even to speak about the things which these people do in secret! But all things are revealed when they are exposed to the light. Therefore, it is said: Awake, you sleeper, arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. Therefore, watch carefully how you live, not as unwise, but as wise [people], making good use of time, because the days are evil. Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Do not get drunk with wine—this is reckless living—but be filled with the Spirit. Speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs! Sing and chant to the Lord in your heart."
