lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Paul took the men, and the next day, he purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them. When the seven days were almost completed, Jews from Asia saw Paul in the temple. They stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him, shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the {chosen} people, the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place!” [They said this] because they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with Paul in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. The entire city was in turmoil and the people came running. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the doors were shut. As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the [Roman] troops that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. Immediately, he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, the Jews stopped beating Paul.
