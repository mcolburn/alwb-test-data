lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, when Christ who is our life is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory. Therefore, put to death what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, depraved passions, lust and greed (which is idolatry). Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming on the children of disobedience. You also used to live in them when you lived among these people; but now, put them all away: anger, rage, evil, slander, and shameful language. Do not lie to one another. You have put off the old self with his doings and you have put on the new self who is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of his Creator. Here, there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free; but Christ is all, and in all!"
