lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, godly sorrow works repentance that leads to salvation; it does not bring regret. On the other hand, the sorrow of the world is deadly. Consider what happened in this case: you experienced distress in a godly way and what serious reaction it worked in you! Yes, what apology, anger, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance [resulted]! In everything you have shown yourselves blameless in this matter. And so, although I wrote to you, it was neither for the sake of the offender nor for the one offended, but so that your devotion to us might be revealed in the sight of God. Therefore, we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced all the more on account of Titusâ€™s joy, because you had refreshed his spirit. I had boasted to him about you, and I was not disappointed! And just as we spoke all things to you in truth, likewise, boasting to Titus [about you] was found to be the truth. His deep affection for you is even stronger as he remembers your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him. I rejoice that concerning you, I can be confident in everything."
