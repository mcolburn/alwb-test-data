Then each person will receive due praise from God. Brethren, I have figuratively applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you might learn the meaning of ‘not beyond the things which are written,’ so that none of you will be puffed up against another. Indeed, who makes you different? And what do you have that you have not received? But if you received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it? [But] you are already filled! You have already become rich and you have come to rule apart from us! Yes, and I wish that you would really be rulers, so that we also might reign with you."
