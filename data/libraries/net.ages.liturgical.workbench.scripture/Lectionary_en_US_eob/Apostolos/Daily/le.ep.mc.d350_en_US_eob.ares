lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, this saying is sure: For if we died with him, we will also live with him. If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. If we are faithless, he remains faithful; He cannot deny himself.  Remind the people of these things, warning them in the sight of the Lord that they should not argue about words: this profits nothing and it brings ruin to those who listen. Work hard to present yourself as approved by God, as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. Stay away from godless empty discussions because those involved in it will become more and more ungodly. Their word will consume like gangrene! Some of them are Hymenaeus and Philetus; they are in error concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past and they bring some people’s faith to ruin.  However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who calls upon the Name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”"
