lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so that he will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not commit sin. But if someone does commit a sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the whole world. This is how we have come to recognize that we know him: if we keep his commandments. The one who says, “I know him,” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person. But if someone keeps God’s word, God’s love has most certainly been perfected in him. This is how we know that we are in him: whoever claims to abide in him should also live just as he lived."
