Wives, be subject to your own husbands as [you are] to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church, and he is the savior of the body. As the Church is subject to Christ, wives should likewise be subject to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her."
