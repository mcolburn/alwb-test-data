lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Beloved, as Christ suffered for us in the flesh, equip yourselves with the same mind; for anyone who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin. Thus you should no longer live the rest of your time in the flesh for human lusts but to do Godâ€™s will. Truly, you have spent enough of your past lifetime fulfilling the will of [non-believing] Gentiles. We used to live in indecency, lusts, excess drinking, orgies, riotous behavior, and abominable idolatries. They think it is strange that you no longer run with them into the same abusive lifestyle, and they speak evil of you. However, they will give an account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead! For this reason, the Good News was preached even to the dead, so that they might in the flesh undergo the judgment that faces all human beings, but [then] live in the spirit as to God. The end of all things is near! Therefore, be clear-minded, self-controlled, and sober in prayer. And above all things, be committed to your mutual love because love will cover a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another, without grumbling. As each has received a gift, use it to serve each other, as good stewards of the grace of God in its various forms. If anyone speaks, let it be as the very words of God. If anyone serves, let it be with the strength that God supplies, so that in all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion unto ages of ages. Amen."
