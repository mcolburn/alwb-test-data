I have become her servant, according to Godâ€™s commission which I received for you, in order to fulfill the word of God. This is the mystery which was hidden for ages and generations. But now, it has been revealed to his saints. To them, God was pleased to reveal the glorious generosity of this mystery among the Gentiles. This mystery is Christ in you, the hope of glory. This is what we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ Jesus. This is what I also work for, struggling with his energy which is powerfully at work in me. I want you to know how greatly I struggle for you."
