lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and if she is content to live with him, he should not leave her. [Likewise,] if any woman has an unbelieving husband who is content to live with her, she should not leave him. This is because the unbelieving husband is sanctified in his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but in fact, they are holy. Yet, if the unbeliever decides to leave, let there be separation. The brother or sister is not under constraint in such cases, but God has called us in peace. Truly, how do you know, wife, if you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, if you will save your wife? However that may be, let each of you lead the life to which God called you as the Lord has assigned. This is what I command in all the Churches. Was anyone called when he was circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised! Was anyone called when he was not circumcised? Let him not be circumcised! Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: what matters is the observance of the Godâ€™s commandments. Let everyone stay in that calling in which he was called. Were you called when you were a slave? Do not let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it. Anyone who was called in the Lord while being a slave is a free human being who belongs to the Lord. Conversely, whoever was called while free is a slave of Christ. You were bought with a price! Do not become slaves of [other] people. Brethren, let everyone, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God."
