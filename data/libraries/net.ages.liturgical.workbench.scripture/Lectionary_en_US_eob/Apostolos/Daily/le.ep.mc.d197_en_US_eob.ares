lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. My defense to those who question me is this: Have we no right to eat and to drink? Do we not have the right to take along a sister—a wife—even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Kephas? Or is it only Barnabas and I who are obliged to work? What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock and does not drink from the flock’s milk? Do I speak these things according to human ways? Does not the law say the same thing as well? For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it for the oxen that God shows care, or does he say these things for our benefit? Yes, it was written for us, because whoever plows should plow in hope, and whoever threshes in hope should have a share in his hope. If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it [such] a great thing if we reap your material things? If others partake of this right over you, should we not even more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we bear all things, so that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ."
