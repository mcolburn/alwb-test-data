lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be closed, and so that the whole world may be brought under the judgment of God. The reason is that by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight because the exact knowledge of sin comes through the law. But now, a righteousness of God has been revealed apart from the law; and the law and the prophets bear witness to it. It is the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. There is no distinction because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. All are being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. God purposed him to be an atoning sacrifice through the shedding of his blood and to be received through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness by passing over prior sins, according to God’s patience. This was also to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time, so that God might himself be just and the justifier of whoever has faith in Jesus."
