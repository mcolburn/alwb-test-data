lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, every Scripture is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, so that the man of God may be fully qualified, completely equipped for every good work. I charge you therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: preach the word. Welcome or unwelcome, insist on it; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and instruction. Indeed, the time will come when people will not listen to the sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, they will gather around themselves teachers who agree with their own lusts. They will turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned to fables."
