lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are living as exiles, scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. This is according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, so that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood. Grace be to you and may peace be multiplied! Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that does not fade away. It is reserved in heaven for you, who by the power of God are protected through faith for a salvation which is ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice, although for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials. This way, may the demonstration of your faith (which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire) be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ! Even though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with unspeakable joy and glory. And so you are receiving the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls. About this salvation, the prophets (who prophesied of the grace that would come to you) did much research and investigation. They were investigating the time and circumstances that the Spirit of Christ (which was in them) pointed to by predicting the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow them. They received revelation that they were servants of these things not for themselves but for you. These [things] have now been announced to you by those who preached the Good News by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven, and [even the] angels desire to gaze upon these things. Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be sober and set your hope fully on the grace that is brought to you by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Be children of obedience and do not conform yourselves to your former lusts as in [the days of] your ignorance. But just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves should also be holy in every aspect of your life, because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.” If you call on him who judges without discrimination according to everyone’s work as Father, spend your lives as exiles here {on earth}, in reverent fear. Know that it was not with corruptible things (such as silver or gold) that you were redeemed from the useless way of life handed down to you by your forefathers. Instead, it was with [the] precious blood of a blameless and pure lamb, [the blood] of Christ! He was foreknown even before the foundation of the world but he was revealed in these last times for your sake. Through him, you believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God. Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth through the Spirit, love one another with a pure heart, in sincere brotherly affection, and fervently! You have been born again, not of corruptible but of incorruptible seed, through the word of God which lives and remains forever. Truly: All flesh is like grass, and all of man’s glory like the flower in the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls; but the word of the Lord endures forever. This is the word of the Good News which was preached to you. Therefore, putting away all wickedness, deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking, as newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, so that you may grow by it in [your] salvation. If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious, come to him who is a living stone, rejected by men but chosen by God and precious. You also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, in order to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. As the Scripture has it: Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen and precious: Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed. For you who believe, this brings honor, but for those who are disobedient: The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone, and: a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. Indeed, they stumble at the word and are disobedient, which is what they were laid aside for. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the wonderful deeds of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. In the past, you were not a people, but now, you are God’s people. In the past, you had not obtained mercy, but now, you have obtained mercy."
