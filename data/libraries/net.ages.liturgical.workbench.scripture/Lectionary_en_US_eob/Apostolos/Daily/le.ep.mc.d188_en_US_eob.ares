lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience. We act in the world in simplicity and sincerity of God (not in carnal wisdom but in the grace of God), and we do so more abundantly toward you. We only write what you can read and acknowledge: I hope that you will accept [those things] even to the end; as you also received us in part. I also hope that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, so that you might have a double blessing. I would then pass into Macedonia, and then again from Macedonia back to you to be sent on by you on my journey to Judea. After making this plan, did I waver in my resolve? Or do I plan things in a human way? For with me, “Yes” should be “yes” and “No,” no. But as God is faithful, our word to you was not “Yes and no.” Certainly the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not “Yes and no,” but in him is “Yes.” However many the promises of God are, in him is the “Yes,” and in him, “Amen,” to the glory of God, through us."
