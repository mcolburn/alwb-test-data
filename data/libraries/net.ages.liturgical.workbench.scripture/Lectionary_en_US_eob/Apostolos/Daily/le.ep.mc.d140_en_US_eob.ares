lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles as well? Indeed, [he is the God] of the Gentiles too, since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by means of faith, and the uncircumcised through faith. Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! In fact, we uphold the law. What then will we say that Abraham (our father according to the flesh) gained? Certainly, if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, although not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”"
