lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged, but when we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, so that we may not be condemned with the world. Therefore, my brethren, when you come together for the Meal, wait for one another. But anyone who is hungry should eat at home, for fear that your coming together might be for judgment. Other matters I will set in order when I come. Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant. You know that when you were Gentiles, you were enticed and led away to those mute idols, however you were led. Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking by Godâ€™s Spirit calls Jesus accursed. No one can say that Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are various kinds of gifts, but it is the same Spirit. There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord. There are various kinds of works, but it is the same God who works all things in all."
