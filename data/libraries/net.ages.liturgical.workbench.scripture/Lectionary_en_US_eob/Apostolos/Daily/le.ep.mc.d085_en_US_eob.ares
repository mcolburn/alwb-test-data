lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service [of food distribution]. The Twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to abandon the word of God in order to serve tables. Therefore, select from among you, brethren, seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom. We will appoint them over this necessary task and devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” These words pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. Thus, the word of God spread and the number of disciples greatly multiplied in Jerusalem, and a large number of Jews became obedient to the faith."
