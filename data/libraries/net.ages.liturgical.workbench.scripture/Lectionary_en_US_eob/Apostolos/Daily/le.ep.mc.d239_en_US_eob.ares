Therefore: ‘Come out from among them and be separate,’ says the Lord. ‘Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you. I will be a Father to you. You will be to me sons and daughters,’ says the Lord Almighty.” Since we have these promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, so that we may bring [our] holiness to completion in the fear of God."
