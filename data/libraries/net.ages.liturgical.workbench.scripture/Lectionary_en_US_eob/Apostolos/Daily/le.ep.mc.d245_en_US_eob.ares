lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, not all flesh is alike: there is human [nature], animal flesh, and also [the nature] of fish and birds. There are also heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly differs from that of the earthly. There is the glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory. This is comparable to the resurrection of the dead: something is sown in corruption but raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor; it is then raised in glory. It is sown in weakness then raised in power. It is sown as a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body just as there is a spiritual body. And so, it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
