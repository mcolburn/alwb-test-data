lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, this grace was given to me, the very least of all saints, so that I might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable treasures of Christ and make everyone see the dispensation of the mystery which had been hidden in God for so long, in him who created all things through Jesus Christ. This happened so that now, through the Church, the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places, according to the eternal purpose which God had in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and confident access through our faith in him. Therefore, I ask that you do not lose heart because of my troubles for you, as they are your glory! And so, I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, asking that according to the riches of his glory, he would grant you to be inwardly strengthened with power through his Spirit. I also pray that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, so that you may be rooted and grounded in love. May you [thus] be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height of Christâ€™s love which is beyond knowledge; and that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to him who is able to accomplish much more than all we can ask or think according to the power that works in us, to him be the glory in the Church by Christ Jesus to all generations, unto ages of ages. Amen."
