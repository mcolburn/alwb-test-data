lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, an apostle (sent neither by human commission nor from human authorities, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead), and all the brethren who are with me, to the Churches of Galatia: Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. Now regarding the things which I write to you, you can see that I am not lying before God. After that, I visited the districts of Syria and Cilicia. My face was still unknown to the Churches of Judea which were in Christ; they only heard, “The one who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy!” And they glorified God in me. Fourteen years later, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and Titus accompanied me. I went up by revelation and I presented to them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles. I did so in private in front of those who were recognized leaders, for fear that I might be running—or had been running—in vain. But even though Titus (who was with me) was a Greek, he was not compelled to be circumcised. This occurred because false brethren were secretly brought in, who sneaked in to spy out the freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery. But we did not give in to them, not even for an hour, so that the truth of the Good News might continue with you."
