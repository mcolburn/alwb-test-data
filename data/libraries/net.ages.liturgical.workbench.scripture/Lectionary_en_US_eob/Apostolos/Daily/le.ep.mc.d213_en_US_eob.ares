I am afraid that somehow, there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots, etc. [Yes, I am afraid] that when I arrive, my God may again humiliate me before you, and I would mourn for those who have sinned before and not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality and lustfulness which they have committed. This is the third time I am coming to you! “At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.” As I have said before and now repeat, as I did during my second visit: now that I am absent, I write to those who have sinned and to all the rest, if I come again, I will not spare."
