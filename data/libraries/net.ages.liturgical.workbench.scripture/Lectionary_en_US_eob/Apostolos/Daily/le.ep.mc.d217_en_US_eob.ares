lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let everyone think of us as Christ’s servants and stewards of God’s mysteries. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful! But as far as I am concerned, it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or according to human judgment. Yes, I do not [even] judge my own self because I know nothing against myself. Yet, I am not justified by this, but the one who judges me is the Lord. Therefore, judge nothing before the time, [that is] until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of every heart. Then each person will receive due praise from God."
