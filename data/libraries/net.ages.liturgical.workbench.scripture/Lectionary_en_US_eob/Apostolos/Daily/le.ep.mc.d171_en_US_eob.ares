lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, God was not well pleased with most of them, because they were struck down in the wilderness. Now these things were written as examples for us, so that we may not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. Do not become idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” Let us not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell! Let us not put Christ to the test, as some of them also did, and they perished by the poisonous snakes. Let us not grumble either, as some of them also did, and they were killed by the destroying angel. Now all these things happened to them as examples and they were written for our instruction, since the ends of the ages have come on us. Therefore, let the one who thinks that he is standing be careful not to fall."
