I give thanks to my God whenever I remember you, and I always pray with joy when I intercede on your behalf because of your partnership in the furtherance of the Good News, even from the very first day until now. I am confident of this very thing: that God who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. It is right for me to think this way about you, because I have you in my heart and because you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News."
