lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, as the lame man who had been healed held on to Peter and John, all the people were greatly astonished and ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s [Porch]. When Peter saw this, he answered the people, “Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you gaze at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk? The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him. But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you. Then you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. By faith in his Name, this man whom you see and know was made strong. Yes, the faith which comes through Jesus has given him this perfect soundness as you all can see.”"
