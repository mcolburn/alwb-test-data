lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I want you to know how greatly I struggle for you, for those at Laodicea, and even for all those who do not know me in person. Yes, I struggle so that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love, and [obtaining] the treasure that is in the full assurance of understanding, so that they may know the mystery of God the Father and of Christ. In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge! Now I say these things so that no one may delude you with convincing words. Although I am physically absent, I am spiritually present with you, rejoicing and seeing your order, as well as the solidity of your faith in Christ. As you received Christ Jesus as the Lord, walk also in him, rooted and built up in him, established in the faith just as you were taught, overflowing from faith into thanksgiving."
