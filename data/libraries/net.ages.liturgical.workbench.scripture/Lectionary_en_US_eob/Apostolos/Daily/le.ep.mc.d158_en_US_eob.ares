lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren: Things which an eye did not see, and an ear did not hear, which did not enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him. Yet, God has revealed these things to us through his Spirit, because the Spirit searches all things, yes, [even] the deep things of God. For what human being knows what is truly human except the human spirit that is within? Likewise, no one truly comprehends the things of God except the Spirit of God. However, we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, so that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God. These are the things we proclaim, not in words which human wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with [other] spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of God’s Spirit because they are foolishness to him, and such a person cannot know these things because they are spiritually discerned. On the other hand, the spiritual person discerns all things and is not subject to mere human opinions. “Truly, who has known the mind of the Lord to [be in position to] instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ! Brethren, I could not speak to you as to spiritual persons, but as to carnal ones—infants in Christ. I fed you with milk and not with meat, because you were not yet ready. Indeed, you are not even ready now because you are still carnal. As long as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, are you not carnal, walking according to human ways? When one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, if not servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him? I planted, Apollos watered, but [it is] God [who] made it grow! And so, neither the one planting nor the one watering is anything: only God makes it grow. Now the one planting and the one watering are the same, but each will receive a personal reward according to his own labor. Indeed, we are God’s co-workers! You are God’s field, God’s building."
