lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, consider yourselves to be dead as regards sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. And so, do not let sin rule in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. Also, do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. Sin will not have dominion over you because you are not under law but under grace! What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be so! Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that, although you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed."
