lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the law had a shadow of the good [things] to come but not the very image of their reality; for this reason, it can never make perfect those who draw near with the same repetitive annual sacrifices. Or else, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the ones who offer divine service, having been cleansed, would no longer have felt guilty for their past sins? But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins. [This is] because it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says: Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but you have prepared a body for me; you had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.’ First he said, “Sacrifices, offerings, whole burnt offerings, and sacrifices for sin you did not desire, neither had pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law), and then he said, “Behold, I have come to do your will, O God.” He takes away the first so that he may establish the second [testament], and by this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all! Every priest indeed stands serving daily, repeatedly offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. But Christ, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God, waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet. By one offering, he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying before: This is the covenant that I will make with them: ‘After those days,’ says the Lord, ‘I will put my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their minds.’ He then says: I will remember their sins and iniquities no more. Now where there is remission of these sins, there is no more offering for sin."
