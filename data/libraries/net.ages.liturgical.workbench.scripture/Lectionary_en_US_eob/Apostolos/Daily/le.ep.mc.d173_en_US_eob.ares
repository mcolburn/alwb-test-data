lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience, I say conscience, not your own, but the other’s conscience. But why is my freedom judged by someone else’s conscience? If I partake with gratefulness, why am I denounced for what I give thanks for? And so, whether you eat, or drink, or whatever [else] you do, do it all to the glory of God. Give no occasion for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the Church of God; even as I also [attempt to] please everyone in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, so that they may be saved. Be my imitators, even as I imitate Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm to the traditions as I delivered them to you. But I desire you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head, and it is as if she were shaved. Indeed, if a woman does not wear a head covering, she should be shaved; and if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, then let her be covered. Certainly, a man should not have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man."
