lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your rational offering of divine service. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. By the grace that was given to me, I tell everyone among you not to think [of yourselves] more highly than you should! Instead, think [of yourselves] reasonably, as God has apportioned to everyone a measure of faith. For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function, likewise we, who are many, are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. We have different gifts according to the grace given to us: if it is prophecy, let us prophesy according to the measure of our faith."
