lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and praying. When Peter knocked at the outer gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that she did not open the door! Instead, she ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. But they said to her, “You are crazy!” When she insisted that it was so, they said, “It is his angel!” Meanwhile Peter continued knocking. When they opened [the door], they saw him and were amazed. But he motioned them with his hand to be silent and told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, “Tell these things to James, and to the brethren.” Then he departed, and went to another place."
