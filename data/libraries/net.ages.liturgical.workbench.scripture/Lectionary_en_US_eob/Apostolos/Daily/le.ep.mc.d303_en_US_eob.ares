lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, do not [sharply] rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers; older women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity. Honor widows who are truly widows. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn how to carry out their religious duty towards their own family, and to repay their parents. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God. Those who are truly widows and abandoned are the ones who have placed their hope in God and who persevere in petitions and prayers night and day. But those who live in luxury are dead even as they live. Give strict orders regarding these matters, so that they may be without reproach. If anyone does not provide for his own, especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever! Only widows who are more than sixty years old and who were married to one man should be enrolled [as widows]. They should be approved by good works: having brought up children, having been hospitable to strangers, having washed the saintsâ€™ feet, having relieved the afflicted, and having pursued every good work with attention."
