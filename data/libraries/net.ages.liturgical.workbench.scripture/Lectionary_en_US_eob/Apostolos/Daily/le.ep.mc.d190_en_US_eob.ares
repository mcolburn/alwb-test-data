lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and people. We are fools for Christâ€™s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor. Even to this present hour, we hunger and thirst, we are naked, beaten, and [we] wander from place to place! We work hard, with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless [in return]. When we are persecuted, we endure. When we are defamed, we try to conciliate. We are made as the filth of the world, as the dirt wiped off by all, even until now. I do not write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. For although you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you do] not [have] many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News. I beg you therefore, be imitators of me."
