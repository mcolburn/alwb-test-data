lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, as we apostles were going to prayer, it happened that we encountered a certain girl who had a spirit of divination and who produced much profit to her masters by fortune telling. As she followed Paul and Silas, she cried out, “These men are bondservants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a way of salvation!” And she did this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned back and said to the spirit, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I order you to come out of her!” And the spirit came out that very moment. When her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. Having brought them to the magistrates, they said, “These Jewish men are causing unrest in our city! They teach customs which are not lawful for us Romans to accept or observe!” When the crowd also rose up against them, the magistrates had them stripped and flogged. After giving them a severe flogging, the magistrates had them thrown into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely. Having received such a command, he threw them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. But when it was about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once, all the doors were opened, and everyone’s bonds were loosened. The jailer, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, began to draw his sword and he was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul cried with a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!” Having asked for lights, the jailer rushed in and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. He brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” They answered, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, you and your household!” Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all those who were in his household. Late as it was, the jailer washed their wounds and was immediately baptized, he and his entire household. He took them into his house and set food before them. He was filled with joy for believing in God, along with his entire household."
