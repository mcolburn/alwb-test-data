lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter said to the people: Men of Israel, listen to these words! Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God by deeds of power and wonders as well as signs which God accomplished through him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves also know. He was handed over by the predetermined counsel and foreknowledge of God, whom you have taken, and by the hands of the wicked, have crucified and slain. God raised him up, having released him from the pains of death, because it was impossible that he should be held by it. For David says concerning him: I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, so that I should not be moved. Therefore, my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover, my flesh also will dwell in hope; because you will not abandon my soul to hades, neither will you allow your holy one to see decay. You made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of gladness with your presence. Brethren, I can tell you with confidence that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even to this day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that from the fruit of his body, God would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne. Foreseeing this, David spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, [declaring] that his soul would not be left in hades and that his flesh would not see decay. God has raised this Jesus [back to life], and we are all witnesses of this fact. Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out what you now see and hear. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but as he himself declared: The Lord said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’ Therefore, let all the house of Israel know with assurance that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” Now when the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and asked Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brethren, what shall we do?” Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the Name of Jesus Christ.”"
