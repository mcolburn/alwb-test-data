lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I declare to you, brethren, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you accepted, in which you also stand. And you are saved by it, that is if you hold firmly to the word which I preached to you. Otherwise, you believed in vain. For I delivered to you, first of all, what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Kephas, then to the Twelve. After that, he appeared to over five hundred brethren at once, most of whom remain [alive] until now, but some have also fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also. Indeed, I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain, but I worked more than all of themâ€”yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. It does not matter whether is it I or they: this is what we preach, and so you believed."
