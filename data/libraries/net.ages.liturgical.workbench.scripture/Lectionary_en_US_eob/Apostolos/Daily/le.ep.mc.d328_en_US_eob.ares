lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, by faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and left the place which he was supposed to receive as his inheritance. He left, not knowing where he was going. By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of the promise, as in a land that was not his own, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise. Indeed, Abraham looked for the city which has foundations and whose architect and builder is God. By faith, even Sarah received power to conceive and she bore a child when she was past the age because she considered that the one who had promised was faithful. Therefore, one man became the father to [people] as numerous as the stars of the sky and as innumerable as the sand on the sea shore, even though he was as good as dead. These people all died in faith, [yet] not having received the promises. They had seen and embraced them from afar, and they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. Certainly, people who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. If they had been thinking of the country they had originally left, they would have had enough time to return. But in fact, they desire a better country, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed of them, or ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them."
