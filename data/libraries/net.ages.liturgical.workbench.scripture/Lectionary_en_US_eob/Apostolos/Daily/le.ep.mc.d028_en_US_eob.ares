lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In the past, God spoke to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways. At the end of these days, he has spoken to us in his Son whom he has appointed heir of all things and through whom he [had] made the ages. His Son is the radiance of his glory, the exact counterpart of his person, upholding all things by the word of his power. When he had by himself made purification for our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become much better than the angels as the Name he has inherited is superior to theirs. For to which of the angels did God ever say: You are my Son! Today I have become your father! and again: I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to me? Also, when he brings the firstborn into the world, God says: “Let all the angels of God express adoration to him.” Of the angels, God says: Who makes his angels spirits, and his servants a flame of fire; but of the Son he says: Your throne O God is unto ages of ages! The scepter of justice is the scepter of your Kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions. And: You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands. They will perish, but you continue. They all will grow old as a garment, as a mantle, you will roll them up, and they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years will not fail."
