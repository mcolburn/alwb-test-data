lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, {all this} for Christâ€™s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong! I have acted foolishly in this boasting, but you compelled me! I should have been commended by you, because even though I am nothing, I am not in anything inferior to the very best apostles. Truly, the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, wonders, and mighty deeds. Were you in any way made inferior to the rest of the Churches, except that I was not a [financial] burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! Here I am, ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I do not seek your possessions, I seek you! Is it not the parents who should be saving for their children, not the children for their parents? I will most gladly spend [for you] and be spent for your souls, though the more I overflow with love for you, the less I am loved. Be that as it may, I did not place a burden on you: {and some might say that} being crafty, I caught you with deception! Or did I take advantage of you by means of those I sent you? I gave instructions to Titus and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps? Again, do you think that we are making an apology to you? In the sight of God, we speak in Christ. All things, beloved, are to build you up."
