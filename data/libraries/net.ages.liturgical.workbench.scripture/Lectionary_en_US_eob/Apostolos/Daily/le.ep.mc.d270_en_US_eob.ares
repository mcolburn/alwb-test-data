lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, whatever you do, in word or in deed, do it all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the God and Father through him. Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them. Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord. Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not be discouraged. Slaves, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking (to please human beings), but in singleness of heart, fearing God. And whatever you do, work with your heart, as for the Lord, and not for men. Know that you will receive the reward of your inheritance from the Lord, for you serve the Lord Christ. But whoever does wrong will receive in return according to the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality. Masters, give to your slaves what is fair and right, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
