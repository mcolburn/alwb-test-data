lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Good News of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures. [This is the Good News] concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord. Through him, we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, for his Name’s sake. Among them, you are also called to belong to Jesus Christ. To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Now I do not desire to have you unaware, brethren, that I have often planned to come to you, but so far, I have been hindered. [My goal] is that I might have some fruit among you also, even as I have among the rest of the Gentiles. I am a debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish. This is why there is so much eagerness on my part to preach the Good News to you also who are in Rome. Indeed, I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ! It is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first, and also for the Greek. For in the Gospel God’s righteousness is revealed from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the righteous shall live by faith.”"
