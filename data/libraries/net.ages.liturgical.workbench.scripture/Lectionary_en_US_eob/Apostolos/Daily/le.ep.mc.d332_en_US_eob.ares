lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, see that you do not refuse to listen to the one who speaks! For if they did not escape when they rejected the one who warned on the Earth, we will certainly not escape if we turn away from the one who warns from heaven! His voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised with these words, “Yet again, I shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.” The words “yet again” indicate the removal of the things that are shaken, since they are created things. But those things which are not shaken remain. But I exhort you, brethren: take this word of exhortation attentively since I have written to you briefly. Know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will see you with him. Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you. Grace be with you all! Amen."
