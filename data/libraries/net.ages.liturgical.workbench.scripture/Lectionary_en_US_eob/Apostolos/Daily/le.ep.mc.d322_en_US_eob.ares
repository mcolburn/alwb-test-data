lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, remember that you, formerly Gentiles in the flesh who are called “uncircumcision” by what is called “circumcision” (in the flesh, made by hands)—that you used to be separated from Christ. You were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ."
