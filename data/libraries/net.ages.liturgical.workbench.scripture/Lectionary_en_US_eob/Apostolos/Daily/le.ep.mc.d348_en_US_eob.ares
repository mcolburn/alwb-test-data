lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you and that is testing you. It is not as if something strange were happening to you. But because you are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice, so that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy. If you are insulted for the Name of Christ, you are blessed because the divine Spirit of glory and power is resting upon you. However, let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evil doer, or a meddler in other people’s matters. Still, if one of you suffers for being a Christian, there is no reason to be ashamed but {instead let such a one} glorify God in this matter. For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us, what will happen to those who do not obey the Good News of God? If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner? Therefore, let those who suffer according to the will of God (in doing good) entrust their souls to him as to a faithful Creator. I exhort the presbyters among you, as the fellow presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and as one who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed: Be shepherds to the flock of God which is in your care. Do not oversee the flock under compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but with eagerness. Do not act as lords over those entrusted to you but become examples to the flock. When the chief shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away. Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to those who are older. Yes, all of you should clothe yourselves with humility and subject yourselves to one another, for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”"
