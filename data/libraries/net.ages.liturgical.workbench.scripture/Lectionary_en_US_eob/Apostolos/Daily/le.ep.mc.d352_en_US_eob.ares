lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Beloved, know this first of all, that no interpretation of Scriptural prophecy happens as something private, because no prophecy ever came by human will: holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit. However, false prophets also arose among the people, as false teachers will also be among you. They will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. Many will follow their immoral ways and as a result, the way of the truth will acquire a bad reputation. They will exploit you greedily with deceptive words. Their sentence, pronounced long ago, does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber. For God did not spare angels when they sinned but cast them down to Tartarus and committed them to chains of darkness to be reserved for judgment. He did not spare the ancient world but preserved Noah (a preacher of righteousness) with seven others when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly. He also turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemning them to destruction and making them an example to those who would lead ungodly lives. He delivered the righteous Lot who was very distressed by the lustful behavior of these wicked people: that righteous man was living among them and was tormented every day in his righteous soul when he saw and heard lawless deeds. The Lord knows how to deliver the godly from temptation and how to hold the wicked for their punishment on the day of judgment."
