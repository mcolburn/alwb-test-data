lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter and John would go up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. A certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb was being carried. Every day, he was laid at the gate of the temple (the one which is called ‘Beautiful’) to ask alms from those entering the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. Then Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, “Look at us!” The man gave them [his] attention, expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, “I have neither silver nor gold, but what I do have, I give to you. In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!” Peter took the man by the right hand and raised him up. At once, his feet and ankles received strength. Leaping up, the man stood up and began to walk! He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God!"
