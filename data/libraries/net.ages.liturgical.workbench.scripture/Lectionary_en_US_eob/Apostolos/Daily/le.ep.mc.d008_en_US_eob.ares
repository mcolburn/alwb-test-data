lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, “all things are lawful for me,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be brought under the power of anything. “Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food,” but God will bring to nothing both of these. However, the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord is [made] for the body. Now God raised up the Lord, and he will also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be! Or do you not know that whoever is joined to a prostitute is one body? For God says, “The two will become one flesh.” But whoever who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin that a person can do is outside the body,” but whoever commits sexual immorality sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit which dwells in you, and which you have from God? You are not your own! You were bought with a price! Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which belong to God."
