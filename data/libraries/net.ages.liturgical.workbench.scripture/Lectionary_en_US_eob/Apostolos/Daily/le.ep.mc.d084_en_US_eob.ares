lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, the apostles went to the temple, and they began to teach. Meanwhile, the high priest arrived, together with his associates, and called the Sanhedrin together, along with the council of the children of Israel. He then sent [word] to the prison to have the apostles brought in. But the officers who came did not find them in the prison. They came back and reported, “Truly, we found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!” Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them, wondering what would come of this. One [officer] came forward and told them, “Behold, the men whom you put in prison are [now] in the temple, standing and teaching the people.” Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without using force because they were afraid that the people might stone them. Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin. The high priest questioned them, saying, “Did we not strictly order you not to teach in this Name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us!” But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men! The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. God has exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior in order to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins. We are his witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit that God has given to those who obey him.”"
