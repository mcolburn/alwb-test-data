lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, my joy would also be shared by all. It was out of much affliction and anguish of heart that I wrote to you with many tears, not to cause you distress but to let you know what overflowing love I have for you. Still, if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not to me, but to an extent—not to be too severe—to all of you. For this person, the punishment imposed by the majority [of you] should be enough. In fact, you should rather forgive and comfort this person, for fear that he might be overwhelmed with excessive sorrow. Therefore, I beg you to confirm your love toward him. I had also written with this purpose: that I might know by a test whether you are obedient in all things. Now I also forgive whoever you forgive. Indeed, if I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven for your sake in the person of Christ, so that Satan may not gain any ground over us; and we are not ignorant of his schemes. Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ as a door was opened to me in the Lord, I had no relief for my spirit, because I did not find Titus, my brother. After taking my leave of them [in Troas], I headed into Macedonia. Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and who reveals through us the sweet fragrance of his knowledge in every place. Indeed, we are a sweet fragrance of Christ to God, both in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing."
