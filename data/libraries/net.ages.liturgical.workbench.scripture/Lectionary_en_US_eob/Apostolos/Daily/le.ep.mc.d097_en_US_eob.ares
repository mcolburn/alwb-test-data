lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, while Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word. The believers who had come with Peter and who were of the circumcision were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles. Indeed, they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. At this, Peter said, “Can anyone refuse the water to these people, seeing that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we [have], and say that they should not be baptized?” He then ordered that they be baptized in the Name of the Lord. After this, they asked him to stay for a few days. Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. When Peter returned to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision criticized him, saying, “You went into the house of uncircumcised people and ate with them!” But Peter began to speak and explained things to them in order: “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container like a great sheet was let down from heaven by four corners, descending and coming down as far as me. When I had looked intently at it and examined [it], I saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky. I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise, Peter, kill and eat!’ But I said, ‘Not so, Lord, for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered into my mouth!’ But a voice out of heaven answered me the second time, ‘What God has cleansed, do not call unclean!’ This was done three times, and everything was drawn back into heaven.”"
