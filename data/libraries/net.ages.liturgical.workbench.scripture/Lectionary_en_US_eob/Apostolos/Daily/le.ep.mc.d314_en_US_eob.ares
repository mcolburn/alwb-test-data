lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Titus, my child, to the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. They profess to know God, but by their works they deny him, being detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. Proclaim what is consistent with sound doctrine: that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, love and patience. Likewise, older women should be reverent in behavior, not malicious gossips, nor enslaved to much wine, but teachers of what is good. They should instruct the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sober-minded, chaste, homemakers, [and to be] kind. Young women should be in subjection to their own husbands, so that Godâ€™s word may not be disgraced. Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober-minded. Be an example of good works in all things. In your teaching, be a model of integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, and soundness of speech that is beyond reproach. This way, those who oppose you will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us. Exhort slaves to be in subjection to their own masters and well-pleasing in all things, not argumentative, not stealing, but [instead] trustworthy, so that they may make the doctrine of God our Savior attractive in every way."
