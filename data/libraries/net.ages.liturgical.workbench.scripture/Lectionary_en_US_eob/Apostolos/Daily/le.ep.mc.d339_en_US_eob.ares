lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, not many of you should be teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. In many things, we all stumble. Anyone who does not stumble in word is perfect, even able to bridle the whole body! Indeed, we put bits into the horsesâ€™ mouths so that they may obey us, and this way, we guide their whole body. Or consider the ships: although they are very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder as the pilot desires. Likewise, the tongue is a little member but it boasts great things! See how a small fire can spread to a large forest! The tongue is also a fire! Among all our members, the tongue is a world of wrongdoing which defiles the whole body. It sets on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire by the fires of hell. Every kind of animal, bird, reptile and sea creature is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. But nobody can tame the tongue! It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the image of God. From the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, this should not be!"
