Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit! Let us not become arrogant, challenging and envying one another. Brethren, even if someone is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness. But watch out for yourself in order not to be tempted. Bear each othersâ€™ burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ."
