lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Simeon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a precious faith like ours, with us, in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. His divine power has granted us all that we need to live in godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by glory and virtue. Through these things, he has granted to us his precious and tremendous promises, so that having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust, you may become partakers of the divine nature. For this very reason, do your utmost to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge. To knowledge, add self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness add brotherly affection; and to brotherly affection, love. Truly, if these things are yours and overflow, they will prevent you from being idle or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But those who lack these things are blind; they only see what is near and they have forgotten the cleansing from their old sins. Therefore, brethren, do all that you can to make your calling and election assured. For if you do these things, you will never stumble."
