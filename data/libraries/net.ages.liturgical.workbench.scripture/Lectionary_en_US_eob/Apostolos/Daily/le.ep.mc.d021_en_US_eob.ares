lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let us pursue things which cause peace, and things by which we may edify one another. Do not overthrow Godâ€™s work for the sake of food! All things indeed are clean; however it is evil for someone to create a stumbling block by eating. It is good to not eat meat, drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak. Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not judge himself in what he approves. But the one who doubts is condemned if by eating, it is not of faith. Whatever is not of faith is sin. Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages but is now revealed, and who by the Scriptures of the prophets (according to the commandment of the eternal God) is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen."
