Instead, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised, just as Peter [had been entrusted] with the Good News for those who are circumcised (since he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision also appointed me to the Gentiles); and when James, Kephas, and John, who were considered as pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, [showing] that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to those who are circumcised. They only asked us to remember the poorâ€”which is the very thing that I was eager to do"
