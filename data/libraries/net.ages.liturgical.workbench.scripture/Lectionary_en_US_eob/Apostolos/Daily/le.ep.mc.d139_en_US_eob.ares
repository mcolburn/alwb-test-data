lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. In fact, those of ‘Israel’ are not all Israel, and just because they are Abraham’s seed, not all are children. But, “In Isaac will your seed be called.” That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are considered as descendants. For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.” Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by our father Isaac. Even before her twins had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose of election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls), it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.” As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” What then shall we say? That there is injustice with God? May it never be! For God said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” And so, it is not about someone willing or running, but it depends on God who has mercy. Thus, the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose, I caused you to be raised up, so that I might show in you my power, and that my Name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” And so, God has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires. You will then ask me, “Why does God still find fault? Who can resist his will?”"
