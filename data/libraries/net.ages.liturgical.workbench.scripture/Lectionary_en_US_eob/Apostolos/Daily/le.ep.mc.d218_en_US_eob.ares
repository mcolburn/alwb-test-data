lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the one who establishes us with you in Christ and who has anointed us is God. He has also sealed us and given us the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. I call God as a witness to my soul, that to spare you I did not come to Corinth. It is not that we have lordship over your faith: we are fellow workers with you for your joy, as you stand firm in faith. But I resolved this for myself: that I would not return to you in sorrow. If I cause you distress, who will bring me joy except for you, the very ones whom I grieve? Indeed, I wrote to you as I did, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from the ones who should be my joy; but I trust in you all, that my joy would also be shared by all. It was out of much affliction and anguish of heart that I wrote to you with many tears, not to cause you distress but to let you know what overflowing love I have for you."
