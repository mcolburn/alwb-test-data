Now concerning the collection for the saints, do as I instructed the Churches of Galatia. On the first day of the week, each one of you should put aside and save according to God’s blessing, so that no collections be made when I come. When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem."
