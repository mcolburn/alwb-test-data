lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, do not throw away your confidence which has a great reward. Indeed, you need endurance in order to receive the promise after having done the will of God: In a very little while, he who comes will come and will not wait. But the righteous will live by faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who believe and so are saved. Now faith is the personal foundation of things hoped for, certainty about things that cannot be seen. By this, people of old obtained approval. By faith, we understand that the universe was formed by the word of God, so that what is visible was made from what is invisible. By faith, Abel offered to God a sacrifice more excellent than Cainâ€™s, and through this a testimony was given to him that he was righteous. God testified about his gifts, and although Abel is now dead, he still speaks. By faith, Enoch was taken away in order not to see death: he was not found because God had translated him. He too had received a testimony that before his translation, he had been well-pleasing to God. Without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, was moved with godly fear. He prepared a ship to save his household and by this means he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
