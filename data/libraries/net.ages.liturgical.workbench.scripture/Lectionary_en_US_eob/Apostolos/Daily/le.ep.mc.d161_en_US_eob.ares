In fact, I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my relatives according to the flesh, who are Israelites. Theirs is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the offering of divine service, and the promises. From them are the fathers and Christ according to the flesh, who is blessed God over all, unto the ages. Amen."
