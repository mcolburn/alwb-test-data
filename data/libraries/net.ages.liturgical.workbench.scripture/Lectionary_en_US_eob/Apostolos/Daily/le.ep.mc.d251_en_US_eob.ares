lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I may hear this about your condition: that you stand firm in one spirit, striving with one soul for the faith of the Good News. Do not be terrified by your opponents. This will be for them evidence of destruction, but to you, of salvation from God. For the sake of Christ, you have been granted the privilege not only to believe in him but also to suffer on his behalf, and so you are engaged in the same battle which you saw me fight and that you hear that I am [still] fighting. Therefore, if there is any exhortation in Christ, any consolation of love, any communion of the Spirit, any tender mercies and compassion, make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord and of one mind. Do nothing through rivalry or conceit, but in humility, consider others better than yourselves. Do not just look after you own selfish interests but each one of you should consider the interests of others."
