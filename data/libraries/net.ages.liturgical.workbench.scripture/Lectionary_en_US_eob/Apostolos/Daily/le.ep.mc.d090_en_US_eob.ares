lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through [that area], he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he reached Caesarea. But Saul, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest. He asked him for letters to the synagogues of Damascus, [giving permission] that if he found anyone who belonged to ‘the Way,’ whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. As Saul was on his journey and approaching Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly shone around him. He fell on the earth and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” He asked, “Who are you, Lord?” The Lord answered, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now arise, go into the city, and [there] you will be told what you must do.” The men who were travelling with Saul stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one. Saul got up from the ground, and when his eyes were opened, he could not see anyone. His fellow travelers led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. Saul was without sight for three days, and he neither ate nor drank. Now a certain disciple named Ananias lived in Damascus. In a vision, the Lord said to him, “Ananias!” Ananias answered, “Behold, I [am here] Lord!” The Lord said to him, “Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah for someone named Saul, a man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying, and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him, so that he might receive his sight.” But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard about this man from many, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. Here, he has authority from the chief priests to bind all those who call upon your Name!” But the Lord said to him, “Be on your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my Name before nations and kings, and to the children of Israel. For I will show him how much he must suffer for my Name’s sake.” Ananias departed and entered into the house. Laying his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me, so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit!” At once, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and was baptized, and after taking some food, he was strengthened."
