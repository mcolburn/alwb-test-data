lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, saying, “Give me this power also, so that whoever I lay my hands on may receive [the] Holy Spirit!” But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! You have no part or share in this {ministry} because your heart is not right before God. Repent of this wickedness of yours and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. Indeed, I see that you are in the poison of bitterness and in the bondage of wickedness!” Simon answered, “Pray for me to God, that none of the things which you have spoken [may] happen to me.” After Peter and John had borne witness and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem and {on their way} preached the Good News in many villages of the Samaritans."
