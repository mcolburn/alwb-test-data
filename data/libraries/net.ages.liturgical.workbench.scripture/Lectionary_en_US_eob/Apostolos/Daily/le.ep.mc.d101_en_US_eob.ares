lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, and they also took with them John whose other name was Mark. Now in the Church that was at Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was surnamed Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. As they were liturgizing to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then, after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them on their way. Being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus. When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues, with John as their attendant. After going through the island to Paphos, they met a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus. He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. Being an intelligent man, the proconsul called Barnabas and Saul in order to hear the word of God. However, Elymas the sorcerer (this is his name when translated) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. But filled with the Holy Spirit, Saul (who is also called Paul), fixed his eyes on Elymas and said, “You are full of all [kinds of] deceit and cunning, you son of the devil and enemy of all righteousness! Will you not stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is against you! You will be blind, unable to see the sun for a season!” At once, mist and darkness fell upon Elymas, and he began to grope around, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. When the proconsul saw what had taken place, he believed and was amazed by the teaching of the Lord."
