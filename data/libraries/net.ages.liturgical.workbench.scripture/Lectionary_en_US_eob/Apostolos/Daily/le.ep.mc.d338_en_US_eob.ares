lemcLI.Epistle.text = "What good is it, my brethren, if someone claims to have faith but has no works? Can faith save such a person? If a brother or sister is in rags and lacking daily food, and one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” and does not give them what the body needs, what good is that? Likewise faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself. Yes, someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works!” Show me your faith by your works, and by my works, I will show you my faith. You believe that God is one! You do well! The demons also believe, and they shudder. O ignorant one! Will you not recognize that apart from works, faith is dead? Was not our father Abraham justified by works, by offering up his son Isaac on the altar? You can see that [his] faith was working with his actions, and that by works, faith was perfected. Thus, the Scripture which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness” was fulfilled, and he was called the friend of God. You see, then, that one is justified by works, and not only by faith. In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, by receiving the messengers and sending them out another way? For just as the body is dead apart from the spirit, so is faith dead apart from works."
