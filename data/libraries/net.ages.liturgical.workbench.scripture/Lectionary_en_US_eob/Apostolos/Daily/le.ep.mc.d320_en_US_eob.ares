lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, this Melchizedek was king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham when he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and who blessed him. Moreover, Abraham gave a tenth part of all to this Melchizedek! By the interpretation of his name, he is, first, ‘king of saving justice’ and also king of Salem, that is, ‘king of peace;’ without father, mother, or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life. He was made like the Son of God and remains a priest for all times. Now consider how great this man was, since even the Patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth from the best spoils! Indeed, the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, although they too are Abraham’s descendants. But this man, who was not of the same descent, received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who has the promises!"
