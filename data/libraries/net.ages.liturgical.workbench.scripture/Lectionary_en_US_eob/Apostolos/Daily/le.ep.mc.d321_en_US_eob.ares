lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, there is a cancellation of an earlier commandment on account of its weakness and uselessness, because the law made nothing perfect. But [now], there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God. Moreover, our Lord was not made priest without the taking of an oath (although others became priests without any oath). But with an oath, God says of him: The Lord swore and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’ Because of this, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. Many, indeed, were made priests [in the past] because they are prevented from continuing in office when they die. But because he lives forever, Jesus holds a perpetual priesthood. Therefore, he is also able to save to the very end those who draw near to God through him, because he lives forever to make intercession for them."
