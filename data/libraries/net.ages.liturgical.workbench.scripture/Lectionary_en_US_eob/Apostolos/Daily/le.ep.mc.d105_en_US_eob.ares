lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others. After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us revisit our brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing!” Barnabas was determined to take John (who was called Mark) along with them. However, Paul did not think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. Then the disagreement became so intense that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. But Paul chose Silas and having been entrusted by the brethren to the grace of God, they departed. Paul went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches.
