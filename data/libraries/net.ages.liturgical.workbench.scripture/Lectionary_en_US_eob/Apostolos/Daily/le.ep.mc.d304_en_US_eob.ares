lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Timothy, my child, do not enroll younger widows: when they are overcome by their sensual inclinations more than by Christ, they desire to marry. [Thus they] fall under condemnation because they have rejected their first pledge {to remain among the widows}. Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and go about from house to house. They are not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they should not. Therefore, I think it best that the younger widows should get married, bear children, and manage their homes; this will give the enemy no opportunity for slander. For already some have strayed to follow Satan. Believers who have widows among their close relatives should take care of them. Do not allow the Church to be burdened, so that it might relieve [only] those who are truly widows. Presbyters who rule well should be accounted worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in preaching and teaching. As the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer is worthy of his wages.” Do not receive an accusation against a presbyter, except at the word of two or three witnesses. Reprove those who have sinned in the sight of all, so that the others may also be in fear. I command you in the sight of God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels: observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by inclination."
