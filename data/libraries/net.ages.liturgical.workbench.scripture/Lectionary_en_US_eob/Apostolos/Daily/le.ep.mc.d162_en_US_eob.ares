lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, we have different gifts according to the grace given to us: if it is prophecy, let us prophesy according to the measure of our faith. If it is service, let us dedicate ourselves to service! He who teaches should do his teaching; or he who exhorts his exhorting. As for the one who gives, let the giving be done with generosity. He who rules should rule with diligence and the one who shows mercy should do so with joy. Let your love be without hypocrisy. Reject with horror what is evil. Cling to what is good. In love for the brethren, be tenderly affectionate with one another; place the honor of others above your own. Do not fall back in zeal; be fervent in the spirit, serving the Lord. Rejoice in hope, endure in troubles, persevere in prayer; contribute to the needs of the saints; look for opportunities to be hospitable. Bless those who persecute you; bless, and do not curse!"
