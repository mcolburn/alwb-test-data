lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, love is patient and is kind; love does not envy. Love does not brag, it is not proud, it does not behave inappropriately, it is not self-oriented. [Love] does not take offence and does not keep track of evil, it does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. [Love] bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. We know [only] in part, and we prophesy [only] in part; but when that which is complete comes, then that which is incomplete will be done away with. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become full-grown, I have put away childish things. Now indeed, we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we shall see face to face. Now I know [only] in part, but then, I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. But now, faith, hope, and love remain: these three, and the greatest of these is love. Pursue love, and eagerly desire spiritual [gifts], especially that you may prophesy. For whoever speaks in another tongue does not speak to human beings but to God; and no one understands, but such a one speaks mysteries in [the] spirit. Whoever prophesies speaks to others for their edification, exhortation, and consolation. Whoever speaks in another tongue edifies himself [only], but the one who prophesies edifies the Church. Indeed, I desire to have all of you speak in other tongues, and even more that you would prophesy. For the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless the one who speaks in tongues also interprets, so that the Church may be edified."
