lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to greet Festus. Since they were spending many days there, Festus presented Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a certain man who was left as a prisoner by Felix. When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the presbyters of the Jews presented an [accusatory] report about this man, asking me to condemn him. I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to condemn anyone to death before the accused has met his accusers face to face and has had opportunity to make his defense in the case against him. Then, since they had come together here, I did not delay. On the following day, I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in. When the accusers stood up, they did not bring any of the charges I was expecting. Instead, they had some dispute against him dealing with their own religion, and about a certain Jesus who was dead, and whom Paul affirmed to be alive.”"
