lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which belong to God. Now concerning the matters you wrote to me about: ‘it is good for a man not to touch a woman.’ However, to avoid sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render to his wife the affection due to her, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does! Do not deprive each other {of marital relations} unless it is by consent and for a season, so that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer. Then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. Nevertheless, I say this by way of concession, not as a command. Indeed, I wish that everyone would be like me. However, each person has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind. Still, I say this to those who are unmarried and to widows as well: it is good for them if they remain as I am. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry. Indeed, it is better to marry than to burn. But to those who are married, I command (not I, but the Lord) that the wife should not leave her husband (but if she leaves, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not leave his wife. As for other cases, I (not the Lord) say this: if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and if she is content to live with him, he should not leave her."
