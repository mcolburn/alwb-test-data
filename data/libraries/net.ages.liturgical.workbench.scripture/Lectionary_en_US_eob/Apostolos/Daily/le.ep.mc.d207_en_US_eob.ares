lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, this ministry of giving which you perform does not only make up for what the saints are lacking; it also overflows into thanksgiving to God. Seeing that you prove yourselves by this service, the saints glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and also for the generosity of your contribution to them and to all. As for them, with supplication on your behalf, they are devoted to you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you. Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift! I, Paul, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ, as one who is humble among you in your presence but bold in my absence. Yes, I beg that I should not have to be bold when I am actually with you by daring to oppose those who think we are acting according to human standards. Even though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh. The weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to overthrow strongholds, to cast down fantasies and every lofty thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and to bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. Once you have given your complete obedience, we are prepared to chastise any disobedience. Do you look at things only as they appear in your presence? If anyone trusts that he belongs to Christ, let such a person reconsider this, that we belong to Christ as much as he does!"
