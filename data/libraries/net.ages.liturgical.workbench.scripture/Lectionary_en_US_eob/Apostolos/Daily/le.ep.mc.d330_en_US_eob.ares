Bear with one another, and forgive each other! If anyone has a complaint against anyone else, forgive, even as Christ forgave you. Above all, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection. Let the peace of God (to which also you were called in one body) rule in your hearts, and be thankful! Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. In all wisdom, teach and admonish each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord."
