lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, since we have such a hope, we use great boldness of speech, not as Moses, who put a veil on his face so that the children of Israel would not see the end of what was passing away. In this case, their minds were hardened, because to this very day, at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains since only in Christ does it pass away. Even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. With unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, we are all being transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, and this is from the Lord, the Spirit."
