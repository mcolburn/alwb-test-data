lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them. When the people heard and saw the signs which Philip was accomplishing, they agreed to listen to what he was preaching. (Indeed, unclean spirits were expelled from many of those who had them, and they came out shouting with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed, and there was great joy in that city). But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city. He amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be a great one, and all listened to him, from the least to the greatest. They said, “This man is the great power of God!” People listened to him because for a long time, he had amazed them with his sorceries. But when they believed Philip [who was] preaching good tidings, the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the Name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Simon himself also believed and after his baptism, he followed Philip closely. Seeing that miracles and signs were taking place, he was amazed. Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. When they arrived, they prayed for the people, so that they might receive [the] Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them. (They had only been baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received [the] Holy Spirit.
