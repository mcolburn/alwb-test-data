lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, I want to you to know, brethren, that what happened to me has turned out to be for the progress of the Good News! It became clear to the whole palace guard and to others that my chains are in Christ, and most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are even bolder to speak the word without fear. Yes, some actually preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, and some also out of good will. The first [group] preaches Christ without sincerity and from selfish ambition, thinking that they are adding affliction to my imprisonment; but the second [group] does so out of love, knowing that I have been appointed to defend the Good News. Either way, it does not matter. I only care that whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed! I rejoice in this, yes, and will continue to rejoice, because I know that this will turn out for my salvation, through your supplication and the support of Christâ€™s Spirit. It is my eager expectation and hope."
