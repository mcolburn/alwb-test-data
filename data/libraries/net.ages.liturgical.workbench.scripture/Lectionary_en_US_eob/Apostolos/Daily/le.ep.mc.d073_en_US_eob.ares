lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them: â€œMen of Judea, and all of you who are [now] staying in Jerusalem, let this be explained to you and listen to my words. For these [people] are not drunk, as you suppose. It is only the third hour of the day! But this is what has been announced through the prophet Joel:  It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions. Your old men will dream dreams. Yes, and on my menservants and on my maidservants in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy! I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, fire, and billows of smoke. The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes. And it will be that whoever will call on the Name of the Lord will be saved."
