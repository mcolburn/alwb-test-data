lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Paul and his company set sail from Paphos to Perga in Pamphylia where John left them to return to Jerusalem. Continuing from Perga, they came to Antioch of Pisidia. There, they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down [to listen]. After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent them a message, “Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak!” So Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said, “Men of Israel and you [Gentiles] who fear God, listen! The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people prosper when they lived as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it. For a period of about forty years, he put up with them in the wilderness. And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, God distributed their land among them by lot. After this, for about four hundred fifty years, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. Then they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin [who ruled] for forty years. After removing him, God raised up David to be their king, even bearing witness to him, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my will.’ From this man’s seed, God has brought salvation to Israel, according to his promise. This was before the coming of Jesus, when John first preached the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.”"
