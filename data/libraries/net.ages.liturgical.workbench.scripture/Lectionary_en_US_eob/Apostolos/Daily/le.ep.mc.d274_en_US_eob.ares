lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, see with what large letters I write to you with my own hand! Those who desire to make a good showing in the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. Even those who receive circumcision do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh. As for me, I shall find glory in nothing, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. In Christ Jesus, circumcision and uncircumcision mean nothing; only a new creation {matters}. To those who live by this rule, may there be peace and mercy upon them, and on the Israel of God. From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen."
