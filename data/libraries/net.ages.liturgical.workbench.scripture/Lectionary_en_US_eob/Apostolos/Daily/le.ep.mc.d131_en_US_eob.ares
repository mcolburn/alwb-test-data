lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more shall we be saved by his life! And not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. Therefore, [even] as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, death passed to everyone, because {of which} all sinned. Until the law {was revealed}, sin was in the world; but sin is not taken into account when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins were not like Adamâ€™s disobedience (and Adam is a type of him who was to come). However, the free gift is not like the sin. For if by the sin of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many! The gift is not comparable to what happened through [the] one who sinned: certainly, the judgment came by one [man] to [result in] condemnation, but the free gift came [as the outcome] of many trespasses to [bring about] justification."
