lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter said to the people, “Repent therefore, and turn back [to God], so that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send Christ Jesus who was ordained in advance for you. He must remain in heaven until the times of restoration of all things, which God announced long ago by the mouth of all his holy prophets. For Moses indeed said to the fathers, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren. You shall listen to him in all that he tells you. And it shall be that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly cut off from among the people.’ In fact, all the prophets that have spoken, from Samuel to those who followed after [him], have also announced these days. You are the children of the prophets, and [children] of the covenant which God made with our fathers when he said to Abraham, ‘In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.’ God, having raised up [to life] his servant Jesus, sent him to you first, in order to bless you as every one of you turns away from his wicked ways.”"
