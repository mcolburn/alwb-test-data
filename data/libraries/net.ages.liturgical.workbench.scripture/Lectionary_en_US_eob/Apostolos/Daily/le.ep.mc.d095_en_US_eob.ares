lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Paul and Barnabas fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and to the surrounding region. There, they continued to preach the Good News. At Lystra, there was a certain man sitting without strength in his feet. He was a cripple from his mother’s womb and he had never walked. He was listening to Paul speak when Paul fixed his eyes on him. Seeing that the man had faith to be healed, Paul said with a loud voice, “Stand up on your feet!” And the man jumped up and began to walk. When the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, shouting in the language of Lycaonia, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” They called Barnabas “Zeus” and Paul “Hermes,” because he was the chief speaker. The priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and they wanted to offer a sacrifice along with the crowd. But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and ran into the crowd, crying out, “Friends, why are you doing these things? We are men just like you, bringing you the Good News so that you should turn away from these vain things toward the living God who made the heaven, the earth, and the sea, and all that is in them. In past generations, he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. However, he did not leave himself without witness: he did good and gave you rains from the sky as well as fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.” Even by saying these things, they could hardly prevent the multitudes from offering a sacrifice to them."
