lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Saul was with the disciples who were at Damascus, and he immediately went in the synagogues to proclaim that Jesus is the Son of God. All who heard him were amazed, and asked, “Is this not the man who did such damage in Jerusalem to those who called on this Name, and who had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests?” But Saul grew even more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that [Jesus] is the Christ. After some time, the Jews conspired to kill Saul, but their plot became known to him. Day and night, they watched the gates in order to be able to kill Saul, but the disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he {truly} was a disciple. Nevertheless, Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. Saul told them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had boldly preached in the Name of Jesus. So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. He talked and debated with the Hellenists, but they tried to kill him. When the brethren became aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him off to Tarsus. And so, the Churches throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and were edified. Walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they continued to grow."
