lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, one is not a Jew by being so outwardly, neither is that circumcision [true circumcision] which is outward in the flesh. Instead, someone is a Jew by being one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter. Truly, their praise is not from human beings but from God. And so, what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? Much in every way! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God! But what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God? May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment. But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous if he inflicts wrath? (I speak as people do!) May it never be! For then, how will God judge the world? For if through my lie the truth of God overflowed to his [own] glory, why am I still judged as a sinner? Why not (as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, so that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned. What then? Are we better than they? No, by no means! For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin. As it is written, There is no one righteous; no, not one. There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks God. They have all turned aside. They have together become worthless. There is no one who does good, no, not so much as one. Their throat is an open grave, with their tongues they have used deceit. The poison of vipers is under their lips; their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their paths. The way of peace, they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.”"
