lemcLI.Epistle.text = "In those days, Peter went down to [meet] the men sent by Cornelius and said, “Behold, I am the one you are looking for! Why have you come?” They replied, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, someone well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to his house and to listen to what you say.” Then Peter invited them in and gave them lodging. On the next day, he arose and went out with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him. The following day, they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends. When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and expressed adoration to him. But Peter raised him up, saying, “Stand up! I am also a man! As he talked with Cornelius, he went in and found many people assembled. Peter said to them, “You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit someone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call anyone profane or unclean. Therefore, I have come without complaint when I was sent for. And so, I ask, why did you send for me?” Cornelius replied, “Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house. And behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and he said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God. Therefore, send [messengers] to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is staying in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside. He will speak to you.’ And so, I sent for you at once, and it was good of you to come! Now then, we are all here present in the sight of God to hear everything that God has commanded you.”"
