lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and of death. What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God has accomplished by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin. Thus he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit [set their minds] on the things of the Spirit. The mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace. This is because the mind of the flesh is hostile toward God; certainly, it is not subject to Godâ€™s law, and indeed it cannot be. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. However, you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, since the Spirit of God dwells in you. But {surely} anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. And so, brethren, we are not in debt to the flesh that we should live after the flesh. For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, then you will live!"
