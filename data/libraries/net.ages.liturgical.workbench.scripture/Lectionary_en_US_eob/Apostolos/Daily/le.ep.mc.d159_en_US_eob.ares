lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, let no one deceive himself: if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, so that he may become wise. Indeed, the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God! As it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.” And also, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.” Therefore, let no one boast in human beings! All things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Kephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All belong to you, and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."
