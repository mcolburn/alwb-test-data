lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the riches of his grace which he showered upon us in all wisdom and insight. He has revealed to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he had determined beforehand in Christ. This came into effect when the times had been fulfilled, to bring together all things under Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth; yes, in him! In him, an inheritance was assigned to us, foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will. [And the end result is] that we, who had hoped in Christ, should be to the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of the truth which is the Good News of your salvation, and having believed in it, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. He is a pledge of our inheritance, until the redemption of those who are Godâ€™s possession, to the praise of his glory! For this same reason, I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and the love which you have toward all the saints, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers. [I pray] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation to bring you to full knowledge of him."
