lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness toward God. Whatever we ask, we receive from him because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight. This is his commandment: that we should believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we should love one another, even as he commanded. All who obey his commandments remain in him, and he remains in them. By this, we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit that he has given us. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can discern the Spirit of God: every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. But every spirit who does not confess Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh is not from God, and this is the spirit of the Antichrist which you have heard is coming, and is already in the world. You are of God, dear children and you have overcome these people because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. They are of the world. Therefore, they speak according to [the spirit of] the world, and the world listens to them. We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us. Whoever is not of God does not listen to us. By this we can discern the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. This is how Godâ€™s love was revealed in us: that God sent his uniquely-begotten Son into the world so that we might live through him. In this is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins. Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also should love one another."
