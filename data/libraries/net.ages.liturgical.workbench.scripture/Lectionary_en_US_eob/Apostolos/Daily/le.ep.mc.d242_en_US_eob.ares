lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her in order to sanctify her, having purified her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present her to himself in glory, without any spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and flawless. In the same way, a husband should love his wife as his [own] body. He who loves his own wife loves himself! No man ever hates his own body but feeds it and cares for it, as the Lord also does for the Church. Yes, we are members of his body, his very flesh and bones! This is why a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife; and the two will become one flesh. This is a great mystery: I speak concerning Christ and the Church. Now concerning you: each one of you must also love his own wife even as his own self; and the wife must respect her husband."
