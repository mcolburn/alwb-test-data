lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Consider your calling, brethren, that not many [among you] were wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, and not [many] of noble birth. Nevertheless, God chose the foolish things of the world to put to shame those who are ‘wise.’ [Yes], God chose the weak things of the world in order to put to shame the things that are strong. God also chose the lowly things of the world, the things that are despised and even the things that are ‘nothing,’ so that he might bring to nothing the things that are {thought to be important}, so that no flesh should boast before God. But by God’s doing, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, as well as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; so that as it is written, “Whoever boasts should boast in the Lord.” When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with excellence of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. Indeed, I resolved not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith would not stand by human wisdom but in the power of God."
