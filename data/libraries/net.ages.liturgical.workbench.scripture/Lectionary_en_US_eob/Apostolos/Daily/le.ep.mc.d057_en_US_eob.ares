lemcLI.Epistle.text = "Brethren, when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation. It was not through the blood of goats and calves but through his own blood that he entered into the Holy Place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. Indeed, if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer (sprinkling those who have been defiled) could sanctify to restore the purity of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to offer divine service to the living God?"
