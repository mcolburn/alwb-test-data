levaWED.Epistle.text = "Brethren, always giving thanks for everything in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, even to God the Father. [Finally], be in mutual subjection in the fear of Christ. Wives, be subject to your own husbands as [you are] to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church, and he is the savior of the body. As the Church is subject to Christ, wives should likewise be subject to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her in order to sanctify her, having purified her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present her to himself in glory, without any spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and flawless. In the same way, a husband should love his wife as his [own] body. He who loves his own wife loves himself! No man ever hates his own body but feeds it and cares for it, as the Lord also does for the Church. Yes, we are members of his body, his very flesh and bones! This is why a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife; and the two will become one flesh. This is a great mystery: I speak concerning Christ and the Church. Now concerning you: each one of you must also love his own wife even as his own self; and the wife must respect her husband."
