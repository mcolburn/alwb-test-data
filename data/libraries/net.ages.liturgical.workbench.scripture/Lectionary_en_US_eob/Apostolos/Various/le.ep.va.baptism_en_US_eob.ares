levaBAP.Epistle.text = "Brethren, all {of us} we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death. And so, we were buried with him through baptism to death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, [likewise] we might also walk in newness of life. Truly, if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be [united with him] by a resurrection like his. It means that we recognize this, that our old humanity was crucified with him, so that the body of sin might be done away with, and so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin. Whoever has died has been freed from sin! But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him; knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over him! For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God. Thus, consider yourselves to be dead as regards sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
