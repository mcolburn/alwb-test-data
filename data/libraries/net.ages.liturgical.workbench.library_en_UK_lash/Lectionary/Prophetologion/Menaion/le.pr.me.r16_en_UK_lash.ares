leprVE.reading.text = "Elias said to Elissaios, 'Stay here; for the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan'. But Elissaios said, 'As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.' So the two of them went on. Fifty men of the sons of the prophets came and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. Then Elias took his mantle and rolled it up, and struck the water with it; the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and the two of them crossed on dry ground. When they had crossed, Elias said to Elissaios, 'Ask me what I may do for you, before I am taken up from you.' Elissaios said, 'Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit.' He replied, 'You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken up from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.' It came to pass that as they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them, and Elias was taken up in a whirlwind as if into heaven. Elissaios kept watching and crying out, 'Father, father! The chariot of Israel and its horseman!' But when he could no longer see him, Elissaios grasped his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. He picked up the mantle of Elias that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. Elissaios took the mantle of Elias that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and they were not parted. And he said, 'Where is the God of Elias, Appho?' And so Elissaios struck the waters, and the waters were parted to the one side and to the other, and Elissaios went over on dry ground."
