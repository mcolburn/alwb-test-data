leprVE.reading.text = "Thus says the Lord: There shall come forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall grow out of the root. And the Spirit of the Lord God shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and piety. The spirit of the fear of the Lord will fill him. He shall not judge by glory nor reprove by hearsay; but he will give judgement for the lowly with justice, and reprove with equity the glorious ones of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall destroy the wicked. And he will have his loins girt with justice, and his sides clothed with truth. Then the wolf shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the bull and the lion will feed together, and a little child shall lead them. The ox and the bear shall feed together; their young shall be together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. An infant child shall put its hand over the hole of asps, and the weaned child its hand on the nest of the offspring of asps. They shall not hurt or be able to destroy anyone on my holy mountain; for the whole earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as much water covers the sea. In that day there shall be the root of Jesse, and he that shall arise to rule nations; in him shall the nations hope, and his rest shall be honour."
