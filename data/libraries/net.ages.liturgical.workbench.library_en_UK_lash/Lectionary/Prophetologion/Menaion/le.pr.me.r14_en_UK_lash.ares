leprVE.reading.text = "Moses led the children of Israel up from the Red Sea and brought them to the desert of Sour.  And they marched for three in the desert and found no water to drink.  They came to Merra and were unable to drink the water from Merra, because it was bitter.  And so the place was named ‘Bitterness’.[12]  And the people started to murmur against Moses and say, ‘What are we to drink?’  Moses cried to the Lord and the Lord showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water and it became sweet.  There God laid down for him[13] statutes and judgements and he tested him there and said, ‘If you listen to the voice of the Lord, your God, and do what is well-pleasing before him, heed his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will not bring on you any of the diseases that I brought on the Egyptians.  For I am the Lord who heals you.’  And they came to Elim and there were twelve springs of water there and seventy date palms.  And they encamped there by the waters.  Then they moved away from Elim and the whole Assembly of the children of Israel came to desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sina."
