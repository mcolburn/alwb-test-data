leprVE.reading.text = "And the Spirit of God came upon Balaam, and he took up his discourse, and said, \"How fair are your houses, O Jacob, your tents, O Israel! Like shady groves, like gardens beside a river, like tents that the Lord has planted, like cedar trees beside the waters. A man shall chrome forth from his seed and will be lord over many nations, and his kingdom shall be exalted and increased. God led him out of Egypt; he has as it were the glory of the unicorn, he shall eat up the nations of his adversaries, and suck the marrow of their fat bones, and pierce the foe through with his arrows. He couched, he lay down like a lion, and like a young lion; who will rouse him? Blessed be every one who blesses you, and cursed be every one who curses you.\" A star shall come forth out of Jacob, and a man shall rise out of Israel; and shall crush the princes of Moab, and plunder all the sons of Seth. Edom shall be an inheritance, Esau his foe shall be an inheritance, while Israel did valiantly."
