leprVE.reading.text = "On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the house of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning. So it was continually. The cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. And whenever the cloud went up from the tent, after that the people of Israel set out. And in the place where the cloud stopped, there the people of Israel encamped. At the command of the Lord the people of Israel encamped, and at the command of the Lord they set out. 'For as many days as the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel will remain in camp. Even when the cloud has continued over the tabernacle many days, the children of Israel will keep the charge of the Lord, and they are not to set out. And it shall that whenever the cloud covers the tabernacle for a number of days, in accordance with the word of the Lord they will remain in camp, and in accordance with the command of the Lord they will set out. And it shall be that whenever the cloud remains from evening until morning; and that the cloud goes up in the morning, they will set out by day or by night. When the cloud overshadows it for a month, or longer, the children of Israel shall remain in camp and not set out. Because they will set out at the command of the Lord'. They kept the charge of the Lord, at the command of the Lord by Moses."
