leprVE.reading.text = "It came to pass in that day that Madiam prevailed against the children of Israel, and they cried to God. And behold, the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak of Joas in Ephrata, and Gedeon his son was threshing wheat in the wine-press, and hastening to escape from the presence of Madiam. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, ‘The Lord is with you, powerful in strength.’ And Gedeon said to him, ‘In me, my Lord; and if the Lord is with us, why have all these evils come upon us? And where are all his wonders, of which our fathers told us, saying, “Did not the Lord lead us up out of Egypt?” And now He has abandoned us, and handed us over to the hand of Madiam.’ And the Angel of the Lord looked on him and said to him, ‘Go in this strength of yours and you will save Israel from the hand of Madiam. See, I have sent you.’ And Gedeon said to him, ‘In me, Lord. How shall I save Israel? See, my thousand is the humblest in Manasse, and I am the smallest in my father’s house.’ And the Angel of the Lord said to him, ‘The Lord will be with you, and you will smite Madiam as one man.’ And Gedeon said to him, ‘If I have found grace in your eyes, and you do for me to-day everything about which you have spoken with me, do not, pray, leave here until I come to you, and I shall bring my sacrifice and sacrifice before you.’ And he said, ‘I am, I shall sit here until you return.’ And Gedeon went and prepared a goat kid and an iphi of unleavened flour, and he put the meat in a basket and the broth he put in a pot and brought them to him under the oak, and approached. And the Angel of the Lord said to him, ‘Take the meat and the unleavened loaves and put them on that rock and pour out the broth next it.’ And he did so. And the Angel of the Lord stretched out the tip of the rod in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened loaves; and fire was kindled from the rock and it devoured the meat and the unleavened loaves; and the Angel of the Lord disappeared from his sight. And Gedeon saw that it was the Angel of the Lord, and Gedeon said, ‘Alas Lord, Lord! Because I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face. And the Lord said to him: ‘Peace to you, do not be afraid, you shall not die.’ And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it Peace of the Lord until this day."
