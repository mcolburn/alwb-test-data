leprVE.reading.text = "Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, \"Ask a sign of the Lord your God; in the depth or in the height.\" But Ahaz said, \"I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.\" And he [Isaias] said, \"Hear then, O house of David! Is it a little thing for you to contend with men, and how do you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel. He shall eat butter and honey before he knows how to prefer evil or choose good. For before the child knows good or evil, he refuses the evil to choose the good. Then the Lord said to me, 'Take for yourself a large new volume and write upon it in with a man's pen, Of making a rapid plunder of spoils; for it is at hand. And get me witnesses, reliable men, Urias the priest and Zachary the son of Barachias.' And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me, 'Call his name Despoil-quickly-plunder-rapidly; for before the child knows how to cry \"Father\" or \"Mother,\" he will take the power of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.' Know you nations and be worsted; give ear, as far as the extremity of the earth; for if again you have become strong, again you will be worsted. And whatever counsel you take, the Lord will scatter it; and whatever word you speak, it will not remain in you, for God is with us.\""
