leprVE.reading.text = "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me. He has sent me to preach good tidings to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim forgiveness to prisoners and sight to the blind; to declare an acceptable year of the Lord, and a day of recompense for our God; to comfort all who mourn, that there be given to those who mourn Sion, glory instead of ashes, an anointing of joy for those who mourn, clothing of glory instead of a spirit of listlessness; and they shall be called a generation of righteousness, a plant of the Lord for glory. And they will rebuild everlasting  deserts, those formerly quite deserted; they will raise up and renew deserted cities, deserted from generation to generation. And strangers will come shepherding your flocks, and foreigners shall be your ploughmen and vinedressers. But you will be called Priests of the Lord, ministers of our God. You will be told, 'Eat the strength of nations', and in their wealth you will be marvelled at; instead of your double shame and instead of humiliation their portion will rejoice. Therefore they will inherit their land a second time, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. For I am the Lord, who loves righteousness and hates robberies from injustice; and I shall give their calf to the righteous, and I shall make an everlasting testament with them. And their seed will be known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the peoples, because they are a seed blessed for ever by God, and with joy they will rejoice in the Lord."
