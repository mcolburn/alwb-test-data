leprVE.reading.text = "The Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, \"I am your God. Be well pleasing before me and be blameless. I will establish my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you greatly; and you will be the father of a multitude of nations. And your name will not be Abram, but your name will be Abraham, because I have established you as father of many nations. And I will increase you very greatly, and I will establish you for nations, and kings will come from you. And I will establish my covenant between me and you and between your seed after you for their generations as an eternal covenant, and I will be their God.\" And Abraham fell on his face and worshipped the Lord. And God said to Abraham, \"You are to keep my covenant, you and your seed after you to their generations. And this is the covenant which you are to keep between me and between your seed after you to their generations. Every male among you shall be circumcised; and you shall be circumcised in the foreskin of your flesh, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and you. And every male child among you shall be circumcised at eight days for your generations. And an uncircumcised male that is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall be wiped out from its race; because it has rejected my covenant.\""
