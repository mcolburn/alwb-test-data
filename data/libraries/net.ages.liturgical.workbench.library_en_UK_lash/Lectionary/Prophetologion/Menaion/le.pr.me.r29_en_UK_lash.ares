leprVE.reading.text = "Moses said to the sons of Israel, 'See, the heaven and the highest heaven belong to the Lord your God, the earth and all that is in them. The Lord preferred your fathers, to love them, and he chose you, their seed after them, above all nations, as it is at this day. So circumcise the hardness of your heart and stiffen your neck no longer. For the Lord your God is God of Gods and Lord of Lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality, who takes no bribe. He executes judgement for the stranger, the orphan and the widow; and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. You shall fear Lord your God and serve him alone, and to him you shall hold fast, and take oaths in his name. He is your boast, he your God, who has done for you the great and wonderful things which your eyes have seen.'"
