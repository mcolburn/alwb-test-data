leprVE.reading.text = "Thus says the Lord, 'Your gates, Jerusalem, shall be open continually; day and night they shall not be shut; that men may bring to you the power of nations, with their kings led in procession. For the nation and kings that will not serve you shall perish; the nations shall be utterly laid waste. The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, with cypress, pine, and cedar, to glorify my holy place; and I will make the place of my feet glorious. The sons of those who oppressed you and troubled you shall come to you in fear; you shall be called \"City of the Lord, Sion of the Holy One of Israel\". Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, with no one to help, I will make you a joy for ever, a gladness from generation to generation. You shall suck the milk of nations, eat the wealth of kings; and you shall know that I, the Lord, am your Saviour and the God of Israel your Redeemer.'"
