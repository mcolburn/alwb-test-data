If the highest heaven is not adequate for you, how then this house which I have built in your name? Unless you, Lord, the God of Israel, look upon my supplication, to hear the supplication and the prayer which your servant makes before you this day, that your eyes be open towards this house, of which you have said that your name will be there; to hearken to the prayer which your servant prays at this place day and night. And may you hearken to the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel, whatever they may pray in this place, and may you hearken in the place of your habitation in heaven, and be gracious to them."
