leprVE.reading.text = "Thus says the Lord: Comfort, comfort my people, says God. Priests speak to the heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation has been completed; her sin has been abolished; for she has received from the Lordâ€™s hand double her sins. The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill humbled; and the crooked paths will be straight and the rough, smooth ways; and all flesh will see the salvation of God. Get up onto a high mountain you who bring good tidings to Sion; lift up your voice with strength, you who bring good tidings to Jerusalem: lift up, be not afraid! I the Lord God, I the God of Israel will hear, and I will not forsake them. But I will open rivers on the mountains, and springs in the midst of plains; I will make the wilderness into pools and the thirsty land watercourses. Let the heavens rejoice from above, and let the clouds rain down justice; let the earth bring forth and blossom with mercy, and let it also bring forth justice. Proclaim a voice of gladness to the ends of the earth, and let this be heard. Say that the Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob. And if they thirst through the wilderness, He will bring them water out of a rock. Be glad, O barren one who have never borne, break forth and shout: many are the children of the deserted, more than of her who has a husband."
