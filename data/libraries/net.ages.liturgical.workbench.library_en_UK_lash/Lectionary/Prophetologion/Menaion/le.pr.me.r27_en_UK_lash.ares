leprVE.reading.text = "A just man, even if he die early, will be at rest. For an honoured old age is not so for length of time, nor is it measured by the number of years.  Understanding is peoplesâ€™ true grey hairs, and a ripe old age a spotless life.  Having become pleasing to God, he was loved; and while living among sinners, he was taken away.  He was snatched away lest wickedness pervert his understanding, or trickery deceive his soul.  For the witchery of what is paltry dims what is good, and the inconstancy of desire undermines an innocent mind.  Made perfect in a short time, he fulfilled long years, for his soul was pleasing to the Lord, therefore he hurried him from the midst of evil.  But the peoples saw and did not understood, nor did they lay such a thing to heart, that grace and mercy are with his holy ones, and his presence with his chosen ones."
