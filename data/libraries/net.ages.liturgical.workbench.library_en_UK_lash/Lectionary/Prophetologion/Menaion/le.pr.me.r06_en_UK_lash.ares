leprVE.reading.text = "Thus says the Lord: Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove your evil doings from your souls; before my eyes cease from your evil doings.  Learn to do good; seek judgement, deliver the oppressed; give judgement for the orphan, do right for the widow.  And come and let us reason together, says the Lord.  Though your sins are like scarlet, I will make them white as snow; though they are red like crimson, I will make them white like wool.  If you are willing and listen to me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you are not willing and do not listen to me, a sword will devour you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this."
