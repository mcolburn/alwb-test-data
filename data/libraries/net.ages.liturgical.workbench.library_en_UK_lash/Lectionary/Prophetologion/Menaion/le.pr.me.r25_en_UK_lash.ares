leprVE.reading.text = "The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In the eyes of fools they seemed to have died, their departure was reckoned a disaster and their going from us a destruction; but they are in peace. For though in the sight of mortals they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. And having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good; because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. He proved them like gold in a furnace and accepted them as a sacrificial whole burnt offering. At the moment of their visitation they will shine out, and they will run like sparks through stubble. They will judge nations and hold sway over peoples, and the Lord will be their king to the ages. Those who have put their trust in him will understand truth; and the faithful in love will abide with him; because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones, and his visitation upon his chosen ones."
