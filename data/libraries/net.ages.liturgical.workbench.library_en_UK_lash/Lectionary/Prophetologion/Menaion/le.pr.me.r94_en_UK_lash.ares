leprVE.reading.text = "In those days, says the Lord, I will gather her that is bruised, and her that has been driven out I will receive, and those whom I have driven out; and her that has been bruised I will make into a remnant; and her that has been cast out into a strong nation; and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Sion from this henceforth and for ever more. Thus says the Lord: And you Bethlehem, house of Ephratha, are not least among the thousands of Juda; for from you there will come forth for me the one who is to be ruler in Israel, and his goings out are from the beginning, from eternity. Because of this he will give them until the moment that she who bears child shall bring to birth; and the remainder of his brethren will return to the children of Israel. And he will stand and will see, and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord, and they will abide in the glory of the name of the Lord his God; for now they will be magnified even to the extremities of the earth."
