leprVE.reading.text = "And it came to pass in the first month in the second year since the children of Israel had set out from Egypt, at the new moon the tabernacle was erected. And Moses erected the tabernacle; he laid its capitals, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. And he spread the curtains over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tabernacle over it, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he took the testimonies and put them into the ark, and put the poles under the ark, and put the covering of the veil on it and covered the ark of testimony, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the table in the tabernacle of testimony, on the north side, outside the veil of the tabernacle. And he set the bread of the on it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the lampstand in the tabernacle of testimony, on the south side of the tabernacle, and set up its lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the golden altar in the tabernacle of testimony before the veil, and on it he burnt incense that had been compounded; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle. And he set the court round the tabernacle of testimony. So Moses finished the whole work. Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of testimony because the cloud overshadowed it, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. Whenever the cloud went up from the tabernacle, the children of Israel would move off with their baggage. but if the cloud did not go up, then they did not move off until the day that the cloud did go up. For the cloud was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all Israel at every stage of their journey."
