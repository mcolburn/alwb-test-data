leprVE.reading.text = "Moses said to the sons of Israel, 'See, I have delivered the land before you. Go in and inherit the land which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that he would give it to them and to their seed after them. And I spoke to you at that time and said, 'I shall not be able to bear you alone. The Lord your God has multiplied you, and see, you are today like the stars of heaven in multitude. May the Lord, the God of our fathers, multiply you so that you are a thousand times more numerous, and bless you as he said to you'. And I took from you wise, understanding and prudent men, and set them to rule over you as captains of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens and as recorders for your judges. And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear cases between your brethren, and judge rightly between a man and his brother and the stranger who is with him. You shall not have respect to persons in judging. You shall hear the small as well as the great. You shall not shrink before anyone's person; for the judgement is God's''."
