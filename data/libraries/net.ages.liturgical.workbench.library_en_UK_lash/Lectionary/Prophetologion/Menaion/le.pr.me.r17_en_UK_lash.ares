leprVE.reading.text = "Neeman, Governor of the King of the Assyrians, came with his chariots and horses, and halted at the door of Elissaios's house. And Elissaios sent a messenger to him, saying, 'Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be cleansed.' But Neeman was angry, and went away, saying, 'Behold, I said that he will come out to me, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and lay his hand on the leprosy, and remove it from my flesh. Are not Abana and Pharphar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed?' So he turned and went away in a rage. But his servants came near and said to him, 'Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? But he has simply said to you, \"Wash, and be cleansed\"?' So he went down and plunged himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored for him like the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed."
