Proclaim among the Nations his glorious deeds  Remind them that his name has been exalted . Sing praise to the name of the Lord, for he has done mighty things.  Proclaim these in all the earth.  Rejoice and be glad, you that dwell in Sion, because the Holy One of Israel has been exalted in the midst of her."
