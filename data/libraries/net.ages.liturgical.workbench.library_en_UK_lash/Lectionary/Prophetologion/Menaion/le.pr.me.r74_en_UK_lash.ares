leprVE.reading.text = "Wisdom has built herself a house and set up seven pillars. She has slaughtered her beasts, mixed the wine in her mixing bowl and prepared her table. She has sent out her servants, inviting with a loud proclamation to her banquet saying, 'Whoever is foolish, let him turn in here to me,' and to those lacking understanding she said, 'Come, eat my bread, drink the wine I have mixed for you. Abandon folly and you will live; seek sagacity that you may have life, and correct understanding with knowledge. He who reproves wicked men will receives from them dishonour; he who rebukes the impious will shame himself. For to the impious rebukes are bruises. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate you: rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give a wise man an opportunity, and he will become wiser; instruct a just man and he will continue to receive. The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord; and the counsel of saints, understanding; knowing the law is the mark of a right mind. For by this means you will live a long time, and years will be added to your life.'"
