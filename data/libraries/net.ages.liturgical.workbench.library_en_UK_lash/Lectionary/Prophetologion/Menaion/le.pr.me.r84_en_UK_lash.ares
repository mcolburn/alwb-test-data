leprVE.reading.text = "In the third year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Baltasar; and the word was true and a mighty power, and understanding was given him in a vision. In those days, I Daniel had been mourning for three weeks of days. And desiring bread, I did not eat, and meat and wine did not enter my mouth, I did not anoint myself with oil until the completion of the three weeks of days. And on the twenty fourth of the first month in the third year, I was near the great river, that is the Tigris. And I raised my eyes and looked, and behold a man, clothed in linen, his loins girt with gold of Ophaz; and his body was as Tharsis, and his face like the sight of lightning, and his eyes like lamps of fire, and his arms and legs like the sight of gleaming bronze, and the sound of his words was as the sound of a crowd. And I Daniel alone saw the vision, and the men who were with me saw nothing; but great amazement fell on them and they fled in fear. And I was left alone, and I saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, and my glory was turned to corruption, and I retained no strength. And I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words I was stunned with my face to the ground. And behold a hand was touching me and raised me to my knees and the knuckles of my hands. And he said to me, 'Daniel, man of desires, understand by the words which I speak to you, and stand upright, because I have been sent to you'; and when he had spoken this word to me I arose trembling. And he said to me, 'Daniel, do not be afraid, because from the first day that you gave your heart to understand and to be afflicted before the Lord your God, your words were heard, and I have come through your words. And the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me for twenty one days; and behold Michael one of the chief Rulers came to help me, and I left him there with the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians. And I have come to make you understand all that will happen to your people in the last days; because the vision is yet for days ahead.' And when he spoke to me in these words, I put my face to the ground and was stunned. And behold as the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood in front of me, 'Lord, at the sight of you, my inward parts were turned within me, and I had no strength. And how will your servant, Lord, be able to speak with this my Lord? And from now on strength will not remain in me, and breath has not been left in me.' And once again there touched me as it were the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me and said to me, 'Do not be afraid, man of desires, peace be with you; be a man and be strong.' And when he had spoken with me I grew strong and said: 'Let my Lord speak to me, for you have given me strength.' And he said, 'Do you know why I have come to you? And now I shall return to make war on the Ruler of the Persians; and as I was going in the Ruler of the Greeks came. But I shall tell you what is ordained in the scripture of truth, and there is not one that upholds me against these, but Michael your Ruler."
