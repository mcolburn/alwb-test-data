lemcVE.reading1.text = "When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to him and said, ‘I am your God; be well-pleasing before me and be blameless, and I will establish my covenant between me and you and I will multiply you greatly.’ And Abram fell on his face and God spoke to him saying, ‘See, my covenant is with you, and you will be the father of many nations. And your name will no longer be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham, because I have made you the father of many nations. And I will increase you greatly and I will make nations from you and kings will come forth from you. And I will set my covenant between you and your seed after you to all generations for an eternal covenant, for me to be your God and that of your seed after you. And I will give you and your seed the land on which you are dwelling, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and I shall be God for them’. And God said to Abraham, ‘You are to keep my covenant, you and your seed after to all their generations.’"

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "15:20-34 and 16:3-9"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "A wise son gives his father joy, but a foolish son sneers at his mother. The paths of the senseless lack intelligence, but a prudent man walks straight. Those who do not honour councils postpone thoughts, but counsel dwells in the hearts of those who take counsel. The wicked will in no way obey it, nor will he say anything appropriate or for the common good. The thoughts of the wise are ways of life, that turning aside he may be saved from Hell. The Lord pulls down the houses of scorners, but establishes the border of widows. An unjust thought is an abomination to the Lord, but the sayings of the pure are reverenced. One who receives bribes destroys himself, but the person who hates to take bribes will be saved. Sins are purged away by almsgiving and faithful dealings, but by fear of the Lord everyone turns from evil. The hearts of the righteous meditate faithfulness, but the mouth of the ungodly gives wicked answers. The ways of just men are acceptable to the Lord, while through them even enemies become friends. God goes far away from the ungodly, but hearkens to prayers of the just. Better a small income with justice than large receipts with injustice. Let the heart of a man consider what is just, that his steps may be set right by God. An eye that sees rightly rejoices the heart, while a good reputation fattens the bones. One who rejects instruction hates himself, but one who guards reproofs loves his own soul. Fear of God is instruction and wisdom, and the beginning of glory will answer it. All the works of the humble are manifest with God, while the ungodly will perish in an evil day. Everyone who is proud hearted is unclean with God, and one who strikes hands with hand will not be held guiltless. The beginning of a good way is to do what is just, it is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrificing sacrifices. One who seeks the Lord will find knowledge with justice, while those who seek him rightly will find peace. All the works of the Lord are done with justice, but the ungodly is kept for an evil day."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "42:5-16"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord, who made the heaven and fixed it, who established the earth and the things in it and who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who tread it. I the Lord God called you in righteousness and I will take your hand and give you strength and I have given you as a covenant of a race, for a light of nations to open the eyes of the blind to lead out those who have been bound and those who sit on darkness from prison. I am the Lord God, this is my name; I will not give my glory to another nor my virtues to carved idols. See, the things from the beginning have come, and new things, which I am declaring, and which have been shown us before they are declared. Sing to the Lord a new hymn you his dominion; glorify his Name from the extremity of the earth, you who go down to the sea and sail it, you islands and you who inhabit them. Let the wilderness be glad and its villages, its hamlets and the inhabitants of Kedar. Those who inhabit the rock will rejoice, from the peaks of the mountains they will shout; they will give glory to God, they will declare his virtues to the islands. The Lord God of powers will come forth and crush war, he will rouse zeal and cry out against his enemies with strength. I have kept silent, shall I also keep be silent always and forbear I have endured like a woman in childbirth, I will amaze and wither at the same time. I will make mountains and hills and all their grass wither. I will make rivers into islands and dry up pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they did not know, and I will make them tread paths of which they had no knowledge. I will turn darkness into light for them and their crooked places into straight. I will do these things and I will not desert them."
