And the Lord God said to Noë, This is the sign of the covenant, the sign that I setting between me and you and between every living soul which is with you for eternal generations. I am placing my bow in the cloud and it will be a sign of covenant between me and the earth. And it shall be when I gather together the clouds upon the earth that my bow shall appear in the cloud. And I shall remember my covenant, which is between every living soul in all flesh, and there never again be water for a flood so as to wipe out all flesh. And my bow shall be in the cloud, and I shall see it to remember the eternal covenant between me and the earth and between every living soul in all flesh which is on the earth. And God said to Noë, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and between all flesh which is upon the earth."

lemcVE.reading2.book = bible_en_UK_lash.Proverbs
lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "12:8-22"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "The mouth of one with understanding is praised by a man, but the dull of heart is held in derision. Better a man in dishonour who is a slave to himself than one who surrounds himself with honour and lacks bread. A just man has pity on the souls of his beasts, but the bowels of the ungodly are without mercy. One who works his own land will be filled with bread, but those who pursue vanities lack sense. One whose pleasure is in banquets of wine will leave behind dishonour in his own strongholds. The desires of the ungodly are wicked, but the roots of the godly are strongly set. Through sin of the lips the sinner falls into snares, but the just escapes them. One who looks with gentleness will find mercy, but one who is contentious in the gates will afflict souls. From fruits of the mouth the soul of a man will be filled with blessings, but the recompense of his lips will be given him. The ways of fools are right in their own eyes, but the wise listen to advice. A fool announces his anger the same day, but a prudent man hides his own dishonour. The just declares open trust, but the witness of the unjust is deceitful. There are those who wound with a sword when they speak, but the tongues of the wise heal. True lips establish testimony, but a hasty witness has an unjust tongue. There is deceit in the heart of one who imagines wickedness, but those who wish for peace will rejoice. Nothing unjust pleases a just man, but the ungodly are filled with evils. Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but one who acts faithfully is accepted by him."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "26:21 and 27:1-9"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "See, the Lord is bringing his wrath from the holy place upon those who dwell on the land, and the land will uncover its blood and will not cover those who are slain upon it. On that day God will bring his holy, great and strong sword upon the dragon, the serpent that flees, upon the dragon, the crooked serpent, and he will destroy the dragon. On that day a fair vine, a desire to make a beginning concerning it. I am a strong city, a city besieged, in vain shall I water it; for it will be captured by night, while by day its wall shall fall. There is no woman who has not taken hold of it. Who will set me to guard a reed in a field? Because of this enemy I have set it aside. Therefore because of this the Lord has done all the things that he appointed. I have been burnt up, those who dwell in it will cry out, Let us make peace with him, let us make peace. Those who are coming are children of Jacob; Israel will sprout and blossom and the inhabited world will be filled with his fruit. Shall he be smitten as he himself smote, and as he himself destroyed shall he be destroyed? Fighting and reviling he will send them away. Are you not the one who meditated with a harsh spirit to destroy them with a spirit of rage? Therefore the iniquity of Jacob will be taken away and this will be his blessing when I have taken away his sin, when they have broken all the stones of the altars in pieces like fine dust; and their trees will not remain and their idols will be cut down like distant thicket."
