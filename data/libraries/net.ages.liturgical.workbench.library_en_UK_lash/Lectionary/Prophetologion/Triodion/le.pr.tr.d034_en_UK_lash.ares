lemcVE.reading1.text = "This is the book of the genesis of humankind; on the day God made Adam, he made him according to God’s image; male and female he made them, and he blessed them; and he named his name Adam on the day he made them. Adam lived two hundred and thirty years and begot a son according to his form and according to his image, and he named his name Seth. The days of Adam which he lived after begetting Seth were seven hundred, and he begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Adam, which he lived, were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died. Seth lived two hundred and five years and begot Enos. And Seth lived after begetting Enos seven hundred and seven years, and he begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died. And Enos lived one hundred and ninety years and begot Cainan. And Enos lived seven hundred and fifteen years after begetting Cainan, and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years and he died. And Cainan lived one hundred and seventy years and begot Maleleël. And Cainan lived seven hundred and forty years after begetting Maleleël and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. And Maleleël lived one hundred and sixty five years and begot Jared. And Maleleël lived after begetting Jared for seven hundred and thirty years and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Maleleël were eight hundred and ninety five years and he died. And Jared lived one hundred and sixty two years and begot Enoch. And Jared lived after begetting Enoch eight hundred years and begot sons and daughters.

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "6:3-20"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, do what I command you and be safe. For you have come into the hands of wicked men because of your friend. Do not be fainthearted, but stir up your friend also for whom you have gone surety. Do not give sleep to your eyes, and do not slumber with your eyelids, that you may be save yourself, like a gazelle from noose and as a bird from a snare. Go to the ant, sluggard, imitate him when you see his ways, and become wiser than him; for he has no husbandry, nor any to compel him, nor is he under a master; he prepares food in the summer and lays aside a great quantity at harvest. Or go to the bee and learn what a worker she is and how serious the work that she does; which kings and private individuals make use of for health; she is desired and held glorious by all; and though she is weak in her strength, she has become outstanding by honouring wisdom. Until when, sluggard will you lie? When will you be roused from sleep? You sleep a little, you sit a little, you have a short doze, you fold your arms over your chest a little; then poverty comes on you like a wicked traveller, and want like good runner. But if you are not to  sluggardly, your harvest will come like a spring, while your want will take itself like a bad runner. A foolish man and a lawless journey by ways that are not good; while the same winks with his eye, signals with his foot, teaches by pointings with his fingers. With a twisted heart he devises evils, at every moment such a person is stirring up troubles for a city. Therefore his destruction is coming suddenly, a deep wound and incurable fracture; he will be crushed through impurity of soul because he rejoices in everything which God hates: the eye of the haughty, an unjust tongue, hands that spill the blood of the just, a heart contriving wicked thoughts and feet that hurry to do wrong. An unjust witness sets lies alight and introduces judgements among brothers. My son, keep your father’s laws and do not spurn your mother’s rules."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "7:1-14"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "It came to pass in the days of Achaz, son of Jotham, son of Ozias, king of Juda, that Rasim king of Aram and Phakeë son of Romelias king of Israel came up to make on war on Jerusalem and they were unable to take it by siege. And a message came to the house of David saying: Aram has made an agreement with Ephraim; and his soul was amazed and the soul of his people, in the same way as a tree in a wood is shaken by a wind. And the Lord said to Isaias: Go out to meet Achaz, you and your son who is left behind, Jasoub, by the pool of the upper road of the fuller’s field, and you are to say to him: Guard your stillness and do not be afraid, nor let your soul be weakened because of these two smoking brands of wood; for when the anger of my rage has passed, I shall heal again. And the son of Aram and the son of Romelias, because they have taken evil counsel concerning you, saying: Let us go up against Judea, and having spoken with them we shall turn them to us, and we shall make the son of Tabeël king for them; thus says the Lord Sabaoth: This counsel shall not abide, it shall not be; but the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Raseim; but yet sixty five years and the kingdom of Ephraim will cease from being a people — and the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron is the son of Romelias; and if you do believe, nor will you understand. And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying: Ask a sign for yourself from the Lord your God in the height or in the depth. And Achaz said: I shall not ask, nor shall I tempt the Lord. And he said: Hear then, house of David: is it a little thing for you to hold a contest with men: What if you hold a contest with the Lord? Because of this the Lord will give you a sign."
