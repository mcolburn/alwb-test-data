lemcVE.reading1.text = "Noë was five hundred years old; and Noë begot three sons, Sem, Cham and Japhet. And it came to pass when men began to become numerous on the earth that daughters were born to them. Now the sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took wives for themselves from all whom they had chosen. And the Lord God said, ‘My spirit shall not abide in these men for ever, because they are flesh; but their days shall be one hundred and twenty years’. Now the giants were upon the earth in those days; and after that, when the sons of God went into the daughters of men, they begot offspring for themselves; these were the giants of old, the men of renown. Now the Lord God, seeing that the wickednesses of men had multiplied upon the earth, and that every one in his heart thinks intently upon evils all his days, then God laid it to heart that he had made man upon the earth and he took thought. And God said, I will wipe away mankind, whom I made, from the face of the earth, from human to cattle, and from reptiles to the flying creatures of Heaven, because I have repented that I made them’. But Noë found grace before the Lord God."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "6:20-35 and 7:1"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, keep your father’s laws and do not spurn your mother’s rules. Attach them to your soul continually and hang then like a chain round your neck. When you walk, lead it along and let it be with you; when you sleep let it guard you, that it may talk with you when you wake. Because a commandment of the law is a lamp and a light, a way of life and reproof and instruction to keep you from an unmarried woman and from the calumny of a strange tongue. Let not desire for beauty conquer you, and do not be trapped by your eyes, nor captivated by her eyelids; for the value of a harlot is that of one loaf; while a woman hunts for the precious souls of men. Will anyone bind fire in his bosom without burning his clothes? Or will anyone tread on fire without burning his feet? So is one who goes in to an unmarried woman; he will not be held guiltless, nor will anyone who touches her. It is not remarkable if some one is caught stealing; for he steals to fill his soul when he is hungry; but if he is caught he will repay sevenfold and deliver himself by giving up all his goods. But the adulterer through lack of sense brings destruction on his soul; he bears pains and dishonours, and his disgrace will not be wiped out for ever. For the wrath of her husband is filled full of jealousy; he will not spare in the day of judgement, nor will he let his enmity go for any ransom, nor will he be reconciled by many presents. My son, guard my words, hide my commandments with you. My son, honour the Lord, and you will be strong; apart from him, fear no other."
