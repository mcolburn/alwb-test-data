lemcVE.reading1.text = "The Lord said to Abram, ‘Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, and you will be blessed. I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse; and in you all the tribes of the earth will be blessed.’ So Abram went, as the Lord God had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Charan. And Abram took Sara his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions which they had gathered, and every person that they had gathered in Charan; and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. And Abram journeyed through the length of the land to the place at Shechem, to the high oak. At that time the Canaanites inhabited the land. And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, ‘To your descendants I will give this land.’ So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "14:15-26"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "The simple believes every word, but the prudent goes to repentance. The wise fears and has turned away from evil, but the fool trusting in himself mixes with the ungodly. A person of quick temper acts thoughtlessly, but a prudent one bears many things. Fools will have wickedness as their portion, but the prudent will take hold of understanding. The evil will bow before the good, the impious will serve at the gates of the just. Friends will hate poor friends, but the rich has many friends. One who dishonours paupers commits sin, but one who has mercy on the poor is blessed. Those who go astray devise evils, but the good devise mercy and truth. Devisers of evils do not know mercy, but acts of mercy and faithfulness are with the devisers of good. With everyone who cares there is abundance, but the pleasure seeker and the callous will be in want. The crown of the wise is their wealth, but occupation of fools is wicked. A faithful witness will deliver a soul from evils, but a trickster kindles lies. In the fear of the Lord is hope of strength, while he leaves to his children a support of peace."
