lemcVE.reading1.text = "Israel departed, he and all that he had, and came to the well of the oath; and he offered a sacrifice to the God of his father Isaac. God spoke to Israel in a night vision, saying, Jacob, Jacob; and he said, What is it? And he says to him, I am the God of your fathers; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there. And I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will bring you up in the end; and Joseph will place his hands on your eyes. And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath; and the sons of Israel took up their father, and the baggage, and their wives on the wagons, which Joseph had sent to take him. And taking up their goods, and all the property, which they had acquired in the land of Chanaan, they came into the land of Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him, his sons, and the sons of his sons with him; his daughters, and the daughters of his daughters; and he brought all his seed into Egypt."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "23:15-35 and 24:1-5"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, if your heart is wise, you will gladden my heart also; and your lips, if they are right, will continue speaking with my lips. Do not let not your heart envy sinners: but be in fear of the Lord all the day. For if you keep these things, you will have posterity; and your hope will depart. Listen, my son, and be wise, and rightly direct the thoughts of your heart. Do not be a drinker, nor stretch yourself in subscriptions to parties, and purchases of meats, for every drunkard and lecher will become poor; and every idler will dress in rags and tatters. Listen, my son, to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother because she has grown old. Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, instruction, and understanding. A righteous father brings up well; and his soul rejoices over a wise son. Let your father and your mother rejoice over you, and let her that bore you be glad. My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. For a foreign house is a perforated wine-jar; and something foreign is a narrow well. For such a one will perish suddenly; and every transgressor will be destroyed. Who has woe? Who has turmoil? who has disputes? and who unpleasantness and gossip? who has needless bruises? whose eyes are livid? Do they not belong to those who spend long hours at wine? to those who search out where drinking parties are? Do not get drunk with wine; but talk with just men, and converse in discussions. For if you fix your eyes on bowls and cups, you will afterwards walk around more naked than a pestle. Finally such a person lies prostrate like someone bitten by a snake, and poison is spread through him as by a horned serpent. Whenever your eyes see a strange woman, then your mouth will speak dishonest things. And you will lie like someone on the high seas, or a steersman in a great storm. And you will say, They hit me, and I was not hurt; they made fun of me, and I did not realise it. When will it be morning, so that I may go and look for companions to go with? My son, do not envy bad men, nor long to be with them. For their heart meditates lies, and their lips speak mischief. A house is built by wisdom, and is erected by understanding. Its rooms are filled by discernment with all precious and excellent wealth. A wise man is better than a strong man; and a man who has prudence than a large estate."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "66:10-24"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Exult, Jerusalem, and all you that love her keep a festival in her.  Rejoice greatly with her, all who now grieve over her, that you may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that you may milk out, and delight yourselves from the entrance of her glory. For thus says the Lord, See, I turn towards them like a river of peace, and like an overflowing torrent flooding them with the glory of the nations. Their children will be carried on the shoulders, and comforted on the knees. As a mother comforts her child, so will I too will comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And you will see, and your heart will rejoice, and your bones will spring up like grass; and the hand of the Lord will be known to those who fear him, and he will threaten the disobedient. For, see, the Lord will come like fire, and his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his execration with a flame of fire. For with the fire of the Lord all the earth will be judged, and all flesh with his sword. Many will be slain by the Lord. Those who sanctify and purify themselves for the gardens and the porches, and eat swine's flesh, and abominations, and mice, will perish together, says the Lord. And I know their works and their thoughts. I am going to assemble all the nations and tongues; and they will come, and they will see my glory. And I will leave signs on them, and I will send out those of them that have been saved to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phoud, and Loud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles far away, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory. And they will declare my glory among the nations, and bring your brethren out of all the nations as a gift for the Lord with horses, and chariots, in covered chariots with mules and canopies, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord, just as the children of Israel bring their sacrifices to me with psalms into the house of the Lord. And I will take from them priests and Levites for myself, says the Lord. For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I am making, remain before me, says the Lord, so shall your seed and your name last. And from New Moon to New Moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh will come to worship before me in Jerusalem, said the Lord. And they will go out, and see the corpses of the men who have transgressed against me: for their worm will not die, and their fire will not be quenched; and they will be a spectacle to all flesh."
