lemcVE.reading1.text = "Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then he would return to the camp; but his servant, Jesus son of Nun, would not leave the tent. Moses said to the Lord, ‘See, you have said to me, ‘Bring up this people’; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favour in my sight.’ Now if I have found favour in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favour in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.’ He said, ‘My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.’ And he said to him, ‘If your presence will not go, do not carry us up from here. For how shall it be known that I have found favour in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and your people, from every people on the face of the earth.’ The Lord said to Moses, ‘I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favour in my sight, and I know you by name.’ Moses said, ‘Show me your glory, I pray.’ And he said, ‘I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, ‘The Lord’; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,’ he said, ‘you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.’ And the Lord continued, ‘See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.’"

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "42:12-17"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. He named the first Day, the second Cassia, and the third Horn of Amaltheia. In all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers. After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children, and his children’s children, four generations. And Job died, old and full of days. It is written that he will rise again with those whom the Lord raises. He is described in the Syriac book as dwelling in the land of Ausis, on the borders of Idumea and Arabia. His name before was Jobab and he took an Arabian wife and begot a son named Enon. He himself was the son of his father Zare, one of the sons of Esau. His mother was Bosorra, so that was fifth in descent from Abraham."

lemcVE.reading3.chapverse = "52:13-54:1"
lemcVE.reading3.text = "Thus says the Lord: See, my servant will understand; he shall be exalted and glorified exceedingly. Just as there many will be astonished at you, so your appearance will be without glory from men, and your glory from the sons of men. So many nations will marvel at him; kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them about him they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate. Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? We brought a report as of a child before him, as a root out of dry ground; he had no form or glory, and we saw him, and he had neither form nor beauty. But his form was without honour and inferior to the children of men. He was a man in suffering and acquainted with bearing weakness, because his face has been away, he was dishonoured and not esteemed. He bears our sins and is in pain for us. We reckoned him to be in toil and in affliction and trouble. But he was wounded for our sins and crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment of our peace, and by his bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in their own way, and the Lord handed him over for our sins. And he, because of his affliction, does not open his mouth; like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he does not open his mouth. In his humiliation his judgement was taken away; who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth; because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death. And I will give the evil for his burial and the rich for his death, because he practised no iniquity, nor was there guile in his mouth. And the Lord wishes to cleanse him of his blow. If you give an offering for sin, your soul will seed a long-lived descendence. And the Lord wishes to take away from the toil of his soul, to show him light and to fashion him with understanding, to justify the just one, who serves many well, and he will bear their sins. Therefore he will inherit many and divide the spoils of the strong. Because his soul was handed over to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and was handed over because of their iniquities. Rejoice, barren one who do not give birth, break out and cry, you who are not in labour, for the children of the desolate are more than those of her that has a husband."

lemcTE.reading1.text = "The hand of the Lord was upon me and the Lord brought me out in Spirit and set me in the middle of the plain, and it was full of human bones. And he led me round them in a circle and lo, there were very many bones on the surface of the plain, and lo, they were very dry. And he said to me: Son of man, will these bones live? And I said: Lord, Lord, you know this. And he said to me: Prophesy to these bones and you will say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord to these bones: See, I am bringing a spirit of life upon you, and I will give you sinews and I will bring flesh upon you, and I will stretch skin on you and put my spirit into you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as he had commanded me. And it came to pass as I prophesied there was a shaking, and the bones approached one another, each to its joint. And I saw, and lo, sinews and flesh were growing on them, and skin came up upon them , but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, son of man, prophesy and say to the spirit: Thus says the Lord: Come from the four winds and breathe on these dead bodies and make them live. And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and the spirit entered them, and they lived, and they stood upon their feet, a very great gathering. And the Lord spoke to me saying: Son of man, these bones are all the house of Israel, and they say: Our bones have become dry, our hope has perished, we are quite lost. And so prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord, the Lord: See, I am opening your graves, and I shall bring you out of your graves and shall bring you into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your tombs for me to bring my people out of the tombs; and I shall put my spirit into you, and you will live, and I shall set you on your land and you will know that I am the Lord; I have spoken and I shall do it, says the Lord."
