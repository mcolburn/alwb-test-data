lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord, who delivered you, the Holy One of Israel: I am your God, I have shown how to find the way by which you should go. And if you had listened to my commandments, your peace would have been like a river, and your justice like the waves of the sea; your progeny would have been like the sand, and offspring of your womb like the dust of the earth; now you would never be cut off or your name destroyed from before me. Go forth from Babylon, as you flee from the Chaldeans; declare this with a shout of joy, let this be heard; proclaim it to the end of the earth; say, ‘The Lord has delivered his servant Jacob!’ And if they thirst, he will bring them through the desert; he will bring water out of the rock for them; the rock will be split open and water will gush out, and my people will drink. There is no joy, says the Lord, for the ungodly. Listen to me, you islands, and attend, you nations. For a long time he will stand, says the Lord. He called my name from my mother’s womb and made my mouth like a sharp sword and hid me in the shadow of his hand; he made me like a chosen arrow, he hid me in his quiver. And he said to me, ‘You are my servant, Israel, and in you I will be glorified.’ But I said, ‘I have laboured in vain, I have given my strength for nothing and for futility; therefore my judgement is from the Lord, and my toil before my God.’"
