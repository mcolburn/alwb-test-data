lemcVE.reading1.text = "Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in a city of the people of the region and dwelt in Sodom. Now the people of Sodom were evil, great sinners before God. God said to Abram after Lot had separated from him, Raise your eyes, and look from the place where you are now, northward and southward and eastward and seaward; for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring for ever. I will make your offspring like the sand of the earth. If anyone can count the sand of the earth, your offspring will also be counted. Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you and to your seed for ever. So Abram moved his tent, and came and settled by the oak of Mambre, which was at Hebron; and there he built an altar to the Lord."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "14:27-35 and 15:1-4"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, it makes one avoid the snares of death. The glory of a king is a multitude of people; without people a prince is ruined. One who is long suffering has great understanding, but one who has a hasty temper is mightily senseless. One whose spirit is meek is a physician of the heart, but a sensitive heart makes the bones rot. Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker, but those who honour him take pity on the needy. The ungodly will be driven away by their evil-doing, but one who trusts in his own integrity is righteous. Wisdom takes her rest in the good heart of a man, but it is not known in the heart of fools. Righteousness exalts a nation, but sins diminish tribes. An understanding servant has the kingâ€™s favour, while by his good behaviour he removes disgrace. Anger slays even wise men, but a submissive answer turns away wrath, while a grievous word stirs up anger. The tongue of the wise knows what is good, but the mouth of fools declares wickedness. The eyes of the Lord in every place keep watch on the wicked and the good. A tongue which heals is a tree of life, and one who watches over it will be filled with spirit."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "40:18-31"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: To what have you likened the Lord, and to what likeness have you likened him? Has the craftsman not made an image, or the goldsmith melted gold, gilded it over and made it a likeness? For the craftsman chooses wood that will not rot and wisely seeks how he will set up his image so that it may not be shaken. Will you not know? Will you not hear? Was it not declared to you from the beginning? Have you not known the foundations of the earth? The one who hold fast the circle of the earth and those who dwell on it are like locusts. The one who set up the heaven like a chamber and stretched it out like a tent to dwell in. The one who appoints rulers to rule as nothing, who made the earth as nothing. For they shall not plant, nor shall they sow, nor shall their root take root into the earth. He blew on them and they withered, and a squall will take them like sticks. Now therefore to what have you likened me and I shall be exalted? said the Holy One. Lift up your eyes to the height and see, who has displayed all these things? He who brings forth his array by number will call them all by name. From his great glory and by the might of his strength nothing has escaped you. For do not say, Jacob, and why have you spoken, Israel: My way has been concealed from God, and my God has taken away judgement and has departed? And now, have you not known if you have not heard? The eternal God, the God who formed the extremities of the earth, will not hunger nor toil, nor is there any searching of his understanding. He gives strength to the hungry and grief to those who are not suffering. For the young will hunger and youths will toil and the chosen will be without strength. But those who wait on God will renew their strength."
