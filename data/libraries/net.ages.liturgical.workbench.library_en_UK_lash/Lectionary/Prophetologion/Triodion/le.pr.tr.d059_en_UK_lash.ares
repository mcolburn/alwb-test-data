lemcVE.reading1.text = "It came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes had become dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, ‘My son’; and he answered, ‘Here I am.’ He said, ‘See, I have grown old and I do not know the day of my death. Now then, take your equipment, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me, and prepare for me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that my soul bless you before I die.’ But Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to his son Esau. Esau went to the field to hunt for game for his father. But Rebecca said to her son Jacob, the younger, ‘See, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying, “Bring me game, and prepare for me savoury food, that I may eat it, and bless you before the Lord before I die.” Now therefore, my son, hear me as I command you. Go to the flock, and from there fetch me two fine, tender kids, and I will make them into savoury food for your father, such as he loves; and you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that your father may bless you before he dies.’ But Jacob said to Rebecca his mother, ‘My brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am a smooth man. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.’ His mother said to him, ‘Upon me be your curse, my child; only obey my word, and go, bring them to me.’ So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savoury food, such as his father loved. Then Rebecca took the best garments of Esau her elder son, the best ones which were by her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son; and the skins of the kids she put upon his arms and upon the exposed part of his neck; and she gave the savoury food and the loaves, which she had prepared, into the hands of her son Jacob. So he took them in to his father. And he said, ‘Father’; and he said, ‘Here I am; who are you, my child?’ Jacob said to his father, ‘I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you commanded me me; now arise, sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.’ But Isaac said to his son, ‘How is that you have found so quickly, my child?’ He answered, ‘What the Lord your God put before me.’ Then Isaac said to Jacob, ‘Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are my son Esau or not.’ So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.’ And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him, and said, ‘Are you my son Esau?’ He answered, ‘I am.’ Then he said, ‘Bring it to me, and I will eat of your game, my child, that my soul may bless you.’ So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, ‘Come near and kiss me, my child.’ So he came near and kissed him; and he smelt the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, ‘See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed! May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine. Let nations serve you, and rulers bow down to you. Be lord over your brother, and your father’s sons will bow down to you. The one who curses you is cursed, and the one who blesses you is blessed.’ And it came to pass after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob his son, when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. He also prepared savoury food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, ‘Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.’ His father Isaac said to him, ‘Who are you?’ He answered, ‘I am your son, your first-born, Esau.’ Then Isaac was greatly amazed, and said, ‘Who was it then that hunted game for me and brought it to me, and I ate of all of it before you came, and I have blessed him? And he shall be blessed.’ When Esau heard his father Isaac’s words, he cried out with an great and bitter cry, and said to his father, ‘Bless me also, father!’ But he said, ‘Your brother came with guile, and took your blessing.’ Esau said, ‘Rightly he was named Jacob? For see he has supplanted me this second time. He took my birthright; and now he has taken my blessing.’ Then Esau said to his father, ‘Have you not a blessing left for me, father?’ Isaac answered Esau, ‘If I have made him your lord, and all his brothers his servants, and with corn and wine I have sustained him, what then can I do for you, my son?’ Esau said to his father, ‘Have you only one blessing, father? Bless me also, father.’ But Isaac was stunned and Esau lifted up his voice and wept. Then Isaac his father answered him and said, ‘See, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven from on high. And you shall live by your sword, and you shall serve your brother; but the time will come when you will destroy and loose his yoke from your neck.’ And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him.’"

lemcVE.reading2.text = "One who keeps a commandment guards their own life; but one who despises their own ways will perish. One who is merciful to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him in accordance with his gift. Discipline your son for thus there will be good hope; do not be exalted in your soul to arrogance. A man who thinks evil will pay a great penalty; and if he commits injury he will lose his life. Listen, my son, to the instruction of your father, that you may become wise at your last days. Many are the thoughts in the heart of a man, but the purpose of the Lord endures for ever. Acts of mercy are fruit for a man, while a just beggar is better than a rich liar. The fear of the Lord leads to life for a man; but one without fear will encamp in places which knowledge does not visit. One who hides his hands in his bosom unjustly, will not even bring them to his mouth. When the pestilent is scourged, a fool becomes more astute. But if your chastise a prudent man, he will understand knowledge."

lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord, I have given you as a covenant for a race, as a light for nations, for you to be as salvation to the end of the earth. Thus says the Lord, who delivered you, the God of Israel, ‘Sanctify the one who despises his soul, who is abhorred by the nations, the slave of rulers. Kings shall see him and arise; rulers, and they shall worship him, because of the Lord; for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and he chose you.’ Thus says the Lord, ‘In an acceptable time I heard you, in a day of salvation I helped you. And I fashioned you I and gave you as a covenant for nations, to establish the land, to apportion desolate heritages, saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’ to those who are in darkness, ‘Be revealed.’ They shall feed along all the ways, on all the paths shall be their pasture. They shall not hunger or thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them, for he who has mercy on them will comfort them, and through springs of water he will lead them."
