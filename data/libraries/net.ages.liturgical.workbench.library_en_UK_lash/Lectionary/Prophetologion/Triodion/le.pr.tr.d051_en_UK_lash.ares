lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not enter this city, nor shoot an arrow against it, nor come before it with a shield, nor cast up a siege ramp against it. But by the way that he came, by the same he shall return; and he shall not enter this city. Thus says the Lord: For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David. Then an Angel of the Lord went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When morning dawned, they were all dead. Then King Senachereim of Assyria turned and departed, and dwelt in Nineve. As he was worshipping in the house of his tutelary god Nasarach, his sons Adramelech and Sarasar struck him down with swords, and escaped into the land of Armenia. His son Asordan succeeded him. It came to pass at that time that Ezekias became sick and was at the point of death. And the prophet Isaias, son of Amos, came to him, and said to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die. You will not live.’ Then Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying, ‘Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you in truth with a true heart, and have done what is pleasing in your sight’. And Ezekias wept bitterly. Then the word of the Lord came to Isaias: Go and say to Ezekias, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears. See, I am adding fifteen years to your time. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and defend this city’."
