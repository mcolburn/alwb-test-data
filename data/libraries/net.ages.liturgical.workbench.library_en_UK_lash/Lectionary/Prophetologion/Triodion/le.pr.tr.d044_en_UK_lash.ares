lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord Sabaoth: In the way that I have spoken, thus shall it be, and in the way I have planned, thus shall it remain, to destroy the Assyrians on my land and from my mountains, and they will be for trampling down and their yoke shall be taken from them and their glory shall be taken from their shoulders. This is the plan which the Lord has planned against the whole inhabited world, and this is the hand that is uplifted against all the nations. For what the holy God has planned, who will scatter it? And will turn away his uplifted hand? In the year that King Achaz died there came this word. Do not rejoice, all you foreigners, that the yoke of the one who struck you is broken, for from a serpentâ€™s seed there will come a race of vipers, and their offspring will come forth flying serpents. And the poor will be pastured through him and paupers will rest in peace. But he will destroy your seed by famine and your remnant he will destroy. Howl, gates of cities, and let troubled cities cry out, all the foreigners, because smoke is coming from the North and there is no possibility of being. And what will the kings of the nations answer? That the Lord has founded Sion and through him the humble of the people will be saved."
