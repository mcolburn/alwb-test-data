lemcVE.reading1.text = "Cain said to his brother Abel, ‘Let us go out into the plain’. And it came to pass while they were in the plain that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him. And the Lord said to Cain, ‘Where is your brother Abel?’ And he said, ‘I do not know; am I my brother’s guardian?’ And the Lord said, ‘What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the earth. And now you are accursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand; when you work the earth it will not put forth its strength to give to you; groaning and trembling you shall be on the earth’. And Cain said to the Lord, ‘My crime is too great for me to be forgiven; if you cast me out to-day from your face, then I shall hide from your face, and I shall be groaning and trembling on the earth; and it shall be that anyone who finds me will kill me’. And the Lord God said to him, ‘Not so, anyone who kills Cain will pay seven penalties’. And the Lord God put a mark on Cain, that no one who found should do away with him."

lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, attend to my wisdom, apply your ear to my words, that you may guard a good understanding; the perception of my lips commands you: Do not pay attention to a worthless woman; for honey drips from the lips of a harlot, who smoothes your throat for a time; but afterwards you will find it more bitter than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword; for the feet of folly lead those who make use of her with death down to Hell, her footsteps are not firmly planted; for she does not go by ways of life, but her tracks are slippery and not easy to pick out. Now then, my son, hear me, and do not make my words of no effect. Make your way far from her; do not go near the doors of her houses, lest you give your life to others and your livelihood to those without mercy; lest strangers be filled with your strength, while your toils come to the houses of strangers; and finally you repent when the flesh of your body is worn away, and you say, ‘How have I hated instruction, and how has my heart turned from the reproofs of the just? I did not hear the voice of my instructor and my teacher; nor did I apply my ear; I was within a little of being in total evil in the midst of the church and the congregation’. My son, drink waters from your own vessels, and the source of your own wells."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "5:16-25"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "The Lord of hosts will be exalted in judgement, and the holy God will be glorified in justice. And they that were despoiled shall be pastured like bulls, and lambs feed on the deserts of those taken away. Woe to those who draw sins to themselves as on a long rope, and iniquities as on the thong of a heifer’s yoke, saying, ‘Let him quickly bring near what he is going to do, that we may see it, and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it!’ Woe to those who call evil good, who regard darkness as light and light darkness, who regard bitter as sweet and sweet bitter! Woe to them that are understanding in their own opinion, and knowledgeable in their own eyes! Woe to your strong ones who drink wine, and your powerful ones who also mix strong drink; who justify the ungodly for the sake of gifts, and deprive the just of justice! For this reason, in the same way that a reed will be burnt by a coal of fire, and be burnt up by a leaping flame, their root will be like chaff, and their flower will go up like dust; for they did not want the law of the Lord of hosts, but provoked the word of the Holy One of Israel. And the Lord of hosts was enraged with his people, and put out his hand upon them, and struck them; and the mountains were provoked and their carcasses became like dung in the middle of the way; and in all this his rage has not been turned away, but his hand is still raised high."
