lemcVE.reading1.text = "The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat, while the water grew less until the tenth month. And in the tenth month, on the first of the month, Noë opened the window of the ark, which he had made, and sent forth the raven to see if the water had ceased, and going out it did not return until the water had dried up from the earth. And he sent the dove after it to see if the water had ceased from the earth. And the dove not finding rest for her feet returned to him into the ark, because water was on all the face of the earth, and stretching out his hand he took her and brought her to himself into the ark. And having waited again seven other days again he sent out the dove from the ark. And the dove returned to him towards evening, and she had a an olive leaf, a twig, in her mouth, and Noë knew that the water had ceased from the earth. And he waited again seven other days and again sent out the dove, and she did not return to him again. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year in the life of Noë, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the water subsided from the earth. And Noë uncovered the roof of the ark, which he had made, and saw that the water had subsided from the face of the earth. In the second month on the twenty-second day of the month the earth was dry. And the Lord God spoke to Noë saying, ‘Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives and all the wild beasts that are with you, and all flesh from the winged creatures to the cattle, and every reptile moving on the earth, bring out with yourself; and increase and multiply upon the earth’. And Noë and his wife and his sons and his sons’ wives with him; and all the wild beasts and all the cattle and every winged creature and every reptile moving on the earth according to their kind came out of the ark. And Noë built an altar to the Lord; and took of all the clean beasts and of all the clean birds and offered them as a whole burnt offering on the altar. And the Lord God smelt an odour of sweetness."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "10:31, 11:1-12"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "The mouth of the just distils wisdom, but the tongue of the unjust will perish. The lips of just men distil graces, but the mouth of the ungodly is turned away. Falsified balances are an abomination before the Lord, but a just weight is acceptable to him. Wherever arrogance enters, there too does dishonour; but the mouth of the humble meditates wisdom. The perfection of the upright will guide them, and the overthrow of the rebellious will spoil them. Possessions will profit nothing in a day of wrath, but justice will deliver from death. When a just man dies he has left regret, but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and brings joy. Justice rightly directs blameless ways, but ungodliness falls in with injustice. The justice of upright men delivers them, but transgressors are caught by their destruction. When a just man has come to his end hope does not perish, but the boast of the ungodly perishes. A just man escapes from a trap, in his stead the ungodly is handed over. In the mouth of the ungodly is a snare for citizens; but the perception of the just is prosperous. By the good things of the just a city prospers, and in the loss of the ungodly there is rejoicing. By the blessing of the upright a city will be exalted, but by the mouth of the ungodly it was overthrown. One lacking in sense sneers at citizens, but a man of prudence brings stillness."
