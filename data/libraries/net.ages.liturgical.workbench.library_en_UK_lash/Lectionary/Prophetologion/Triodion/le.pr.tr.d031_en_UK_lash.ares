lemcVE.reading1.text = "The Lord God made for Adam and his wife tunics of skin, and clothed them. And God said: See, Adam has become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now lest he should ever stretch out his hand and take from the tree of life and eat and live for ever. And the Lord God sent him out of the Paradise of delight to work the earth from which he had been taken. And he cast Adam out and settled him opposite the Paradise of delight; and he stationed the Cherubim, and the sword of flame turning about, to guard the way to the tree of life. And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and said, ‘I have gained a man through God’. And she gave birth once more to his brother Abel. And Abel became a shepherd of sheep, while Cain worked the earth. And it came to pass after some days that Cain brought from the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord. And Abel also brought from the firstborn of his sheep and of his fatlings. And God look upon Abel and upon his gifts; while he did not regard Cain and his gifts. And Cain was very sorrowful, and his face fell. And the Lord God said to Cain, ‘Why have you become very sorrowful, and why has your face fallen? If you offered correctly but did not divide correctly, did you not sin? Be still; his recourse shall be to you, and you shall rule him’."

lemcVE.reading2.text = "The Lord resists the proud, but to the humble he gives grace. The wise will inherit glory, but the ungodly have exalted dishonour. Hear, children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. For I give you a good gift, do not forsake my law. For I too was a son obedient to my father and beloved in the sight of my mother. They taught me and said: Let our word be fixed in your heart, keep the commandments, do not forget, do not neglect the speech of my mouth, do not forsake it, and it will cling to you; love it, and it will watch over you. Trench it about and it will exalt you; honour it, that it may embrace you, that it may bestow on your head a crown of graces, may shield you with a crown of delight. Hear, my son, and accept my words, and years of life will be multiplied for you, that ways of life may become many for you. For I teach you ways of wisdom, I make you go up on right tracks. For if you journey, your steps will not be straitened; while if you run, you will not toil. Grasp my instruction; do not let it go, but guard it for yourself for your life. Do not enter the ways of the ungodly, do not imitate the ways of transgressors. In whatever place they pitch camp, do not enter there; keep away from them and pass by. For they cannot sleep unless they have done evil; sleep has been taken from them and they do not slumber. For their bread is the bread of ungodliness, while they are drunk with lawless wine. But the ways of the just shine like light; they advance and give light until the day is established. The ways of the ungodly are dark, they do not know how they stumble. My son, attend to my speech, apply your ear to my words. So that your springs may not fail you, guard them in your heart. For there is life for those who find them, and healing for all flesh."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "5:7-16"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the people of Juda the beloved plant. I waited for it to produce judgement, but it produced iniquity, and not justice, but a cry. Woe to those who join house to house, and who bring field close to field, that they may remove something of their neighbour’s! Will you alone dwell on the land? For these things have been heard by the ears of the Lord of hosts. For though many houses come into being, great and fair, they will become a desert, and there will be no inhabitants in them. For where ten yoke of oxen work, it will produce one jar-full; and the one who sows twelve bushels will produce one. Woe to those who rise in the morning and go after strong drink, staying until late; for the wine will heat them; for with harp and psaltery and drums and flutes they drink wine, while they do not regard the works of the Lord, and they do not keep in mind the works of his hands. Therefore my people has become a prisoner, through not knowing the Lord; and has become a multitude of corpses, through famine and thirst for water. And Hell has broadened its soul and opened its mouth, so as to leave no interval; and her glorious ones will go down and her great and her rich and her pestilent ones, and the one who rejoiced in her. And a man shall be humbled, and a man shall be dishonoured; and the lofty eyes shall be humbled. And the Lord of hosts will be exalted in judgement; and the holy God will be glorified in justice."
