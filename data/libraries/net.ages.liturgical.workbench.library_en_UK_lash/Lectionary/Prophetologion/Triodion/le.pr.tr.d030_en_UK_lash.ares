lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: God will shine out on that day, in counsel with glory on the earth, to exalt and glorify the remnant of Israel. And there will be a remnant in Sion and a remnant in Jerusalem, they will all be called ‘Holy’ who are inscribed for life in Jerusalem. Because the Lord will wash the stain of the sons and daughters of Sion, and will cleanse the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of them, with a spirit of judgement and a spirit of burning. And the Lord will come, and it shall be that every place of mount Sion, and all the region round it a cloud will shelter by day, and like smoke and the light of fire burning by night, and it will be sheltered with all the glory. And it shall be for a shelter from heat, and with a shelter and a hiding place from harshness and rain. Let me sing for my beloved a song of my loved one for my vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a hill, on a fertile place. And I made a hedge round it and dug a trench and planted a vine of Sorek and built a tower in the middle of it, and dug out a vat in it, and I waited for it to produce grapes, and it produced thorns. And now inhabitants of Jerusalem, and people of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard. What should I yet have done for vineyard, and did not do? Because I waited for it to produce grapes, but it produced thorns. Now I will tell you what I shall do to my vineyard; I shall take out its hedge, and it will be for plundering; and I shall pull down its wall, and it will be for trampling under foot. And I will abandon my vineyard, and it will not be pruned or dug; and thorns will come up on it, as on fallow land; and I shall command the clouds not to shower rain on it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and a man of Juda the beloved plant."
