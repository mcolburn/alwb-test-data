lemcVE.reading1.text = "Noë was a just man, perfect in his generation; Noë was well-pleasing to God. Noë begot three sons, Sem, Cham and Japhet. Now the earth had become corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with injustice. And the Lord God saw the earth, and it was utterly corrupt, because all flesh had utterly corrupted his way upon earth. And the Lord God said to Noë, ‘The moment for all mankind has come before me, because the earth has been filled with injustice because of them, and behold I am utterly destroying them and the earth. So make an ark for yourself from squared logs. You will make the ark with compartments and you will pitch it outside and inside with pitch. And you will make the ark thus: the length of the ark three hundred cubits and the breadth fifty and its height thirty. You will make the ark by narrowing it and complete it above to one cubit; you will make the door of the ark from its side; you will make it with chambers, of two levels and three levels. While I am bringing the flood, water upon the earth to destroy all flesh, in which there is the spirit of life, under heaven; and whatever there is upon the earth shall die. And I shall establish my testament with you; you are to enter the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. And of all the cattle and all the reptiles and all the wild beasts and all flesh you are to bring into the ark two by two, to feed them with yourself; male and female they are to be. Of all the winged birds according to their kind, and of all the cattle according to their kind, and of all the reptiles which creep upon the earth according to their kind, two by two of all they shall enter to you to be fed with you, male and female, while you shall take for yourself of all the foods which you eat, and you shall gather them to yourself, and they shall be for you and for them to eat’. And Noë did everything whatever the Lord God had commanded him, so he did."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "8:1-21"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, you will proclaim wisdom, that prudence may obey you; for she is on high peaks, she stands in the midst of the paths; she takes her seat by the gates of the powerful, she is hymned in the entrances. You men, I exhort you, and I utter my voice to the sons of men; you innocent, understand cunning, you that are untaught take on heart. Hearken to me, for I speak solemn things and shall open correct things from my lips; because my throat will meditate truth, while lying lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are with justice, crooked or twisted is in them; They are all present to those who understand and right to those who find knowledge. Accept instruction and not silver, and knowledge beyond tried gold; for wisdom is better than valuable stones, all that is precious is not equal to her worth. I wisdom have made counsel my dwelling, and I have called upon knowledge and understanding. The fear of the Lord hates injustice, arrogance and pride and ways of evil people; I have hated the perverted ways of the wicked; mine is counsel, mine is safety, mine is prudence, mine is strength; through me kings will reign and the powerful write justice; through me nobles become noble, and tyrants through me hold sway on earth. I love those who are my friends, while those who seek me will find grace. Wealth and glory are mine and the possession of many things and justice. To gather my fruit is far better than gold and precious stone, my produce is better than choice silver. I walk in ways of justice and I pass my time amid paths of justice, that I may divide property to those who love me and fill their treasuries with good things."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "9:9-21, 10:1-4"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: All the people of Ephraim will know and those who dwell in Samaria with insolence and an exalted heart, saying: Bricks have fallen, but come, let us hew stones and cut down sycamores and cedars and let us build a tower; and God will dash those who rise against mount Sion against them, and their enemies he will scatter, Syria from the rising of the sun and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, those who devour Israel with their whole mouth. In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. But the people was not turned away until it was struck, and they did not seek the Lord. And the Lord away from Israel head and tail, great and small in that day, elder and those who marvel at persons (this is the start) and prophet teaching things that are unlawful (this is the tail). And those who call this people blest will lead them astray, and they lead them astray that they may gulp them down. Because of this the Lord will not rejoice at their youths and will not have mercy on their orphans and on their widows, because all are lawless and evil, and every mouth speaks things that are not just. And iniquity will burn like fire and like dry grass it will be devoured by fire; and it will burn in the thickets of the wood, and all that is round about the hills will be devoured. Because of the anger of the Lord the whole land has burned, and the people will be as though burnt up by fire; a man will not have mercy on his brother, but he will turn aside to the right because he will be hungry and he will eat from the left, and a man will by no means be filled by eating the flesh of his arm. For Manasses will eat of Ephraim and Ephraim of Manasses, because together they will besiege Juda. In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. Woe to those who write evil; for in writing they write evil, turning aside judgement from the poor, snatching judgement from the paupers of my people, so that widows are for plunder and orphans for forage. And what will they do in the day of visitation? Four your trouble will come from afar; and to whom will flee to be helped? And where will you abandon your glory so as not to fall into captivity? In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised."
