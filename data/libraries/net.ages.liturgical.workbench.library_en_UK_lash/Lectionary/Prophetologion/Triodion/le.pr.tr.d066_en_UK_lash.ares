lemcVE.reading1.text = "These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob their father, each with all his household: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Juda, Issachar, Zabulon, Benjamin, Dan and Nephtalim, Gad and Aser. Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of people born to Jacob was seventy-five. Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and that whole generation. But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them. Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. He said to his people, ‘Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and stronger than we are. Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.’ Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labour. They built supply cities, Pitho, Rameses and On, which is Helioupolis, for Pharao. But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and grew stronger, so that the Egyptians came to abominate the Israelites. The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them. The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Sephora and the other Phua, ‘When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and they are about to give birth, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, spare her’. But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live. So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, ‘Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?’ The midwives said to Pharao, ‘Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they give birth before the midwives comes to them’. So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "1:1-12"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "There was once a man in the land of Ausis whose name was Job. That man was blameless, just and true, one who feared God and turned away from every evil deed. There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she asses in pasture and very many servants, and great works of husbandry on the earth; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east. His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another’s houses in turn each day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. And when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and purify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer sacrifices according to the number of them all; and a calf for a sin-offering for their souls. For Job said, ‘It may be that my children have thought evil against God in their hearts.’ This is what Job always did. One day the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the devil also came among them. The Lord said to the devil, ‘Where have you come from?’ The devil answered the Lord, ‘From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down under heaven.’ The Lord said to the devil, ‘Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a man blameless, just and true who fears God and turns away from every evil deed.’ Then the devil answered the Lord, ‘Does Job reverence God for nothing? Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have increased in the land. But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will indeed bless you to your face.’ The Lord said to the devil, ‘Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not touch!’ So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord."

lemcTE.reading1.text = "When the living creatures moved, the wheels also moved; when they stopped, the others stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of life was in the wheels. Over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of a firmament, shining like crystal, spread out above their wings. Under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the creatures had two wings covering its body. When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the voice of God Sadday, a sound of speech like the sound of an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings. And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads; when they stopped, they let down their wings. And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was the likeness of a human form. Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a splendour all around. Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendour all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord."
