lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, if you become wise for yourself, you will also be wise for your neighbours; while if you prove wicked, you will draw wickedness alone. One who relies on falsehoods, shepherds winds, while he will pursue flying birds; for he has left the ways of his own vineyard, while he has made the axes of his field go astray. He walks through a waterless desert and a land appointed to drought, he gathers fruitlessness with his hands. A foolish and insolent woman, who does not know shame, comes to lack a morsel; she sits at the doors of her house, on a bench openly in the streets, inviting the passers-by and those who are going straight on their ways: Whichever of you is most foolish, let him turn aside to me; and [she] exhorts those who lack prudence, saying: Touch the secret bread of pleasure and drink the sweet water of theft. But he does not know that those born of earth are destroyed by her, and he encounters a trap of Hell. But hurry away, do not delay in the place and do not rest your eye on her; for thus you will pass through strange water, pass over a strange river; keep away from strange water and do not drink of a strange spring, that you may live a long time and that years may be added to your life."

lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: In that day there shall be a root of Jesse and the one who rises to rule the nations, in him the nations will hope, and his rest will be honour. And in that day it shall be that the Lord will continue to reveal his hand to be zealous for the remnant that is left of the people, that will have been left by the Assyrians and from Egypt and Babylonia and Ethiopia and from the Elamites and from the rising of the sun and from Arabia. And he will raise a sign for the nations and gather the lost of Israel and the scattered of Juda he will gather from the four corners of the earth. And the jealousy of Ephraim will be removed and the enemies of Juda perish. And it shall be for Israel as on the day when he came out of Egypt. And you will say on that day, ‘I shall bless you, O Lord, because you were angry with me and you turned away your wrath and had mercy on me. See, my God, my saviour is the Lord, I shall trust in him and I shall not be afraid, because the Lord is my glory and my praise, and has become my salvation’."
