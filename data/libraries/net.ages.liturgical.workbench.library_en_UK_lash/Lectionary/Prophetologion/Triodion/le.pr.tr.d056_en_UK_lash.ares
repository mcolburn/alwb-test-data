lemcVE.reading1.text = "It came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham and said to him, ‘Abraham, Abraham.’ He said, ‘Here I am.’ And he said, ‘Take your son, your beloved, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the high land and offer him there as a whole burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you.’ But Abraham arose in the morning and saddled his ass. He took with him two lads and Isaac his son and having split wood for a whole burnt offering he arose and went and came to the place of which God had spoken to him on the third day. And Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. And Abraham said to his lads, ‘Sit here with the ass while I and the lad will go over there and when we have worshipped we will return to you.’ Abraham took the wood for the whole burnt offering and put it on Isaac his son, while he took in his hands both the fire and the knife, and they went the two of them together. Isaac said to his father Abraham, ‘Father.’ He said, ‘What is it, child?’ He said, ‘See, here are fire and wood. Where is the sheep for the whole burnt offering?’ Abraham said, ‘God will see for himself to a sheep for the whole burnt offering, child.’ They went both of them together and came to the place of which God had told him. And there Abraham built the altar and put the wood on it and he bound his son Isaac and put him on the altar on top of the wood. And Abraham stretched out his hand to take the knife to slay his son. And the Angel of the Lord called him from heaven and said, ‘Abraham, Abraham.’ But he said, ‘Here I am.’ And he said, ‘Do not lay your hand on the child nor do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God and you have not spared your beloved son for my sake.’ And raising his eyes Abraham saw and see, a ram caught in a Sabek plant by the horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a whole burnt offering instead of his son Isaac. And Abraham called the name of the place The Lord saw, so that they say today, on the mountain the Lord appeared. And the Angel of the Lord called Abraham a second time from heaven saying, ‘By myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing and have not spared your beloved son for my sake, multiplying I will multiply your seed like all the stars of heaven and like the sand which is beside the edge of the sea; and your seed will inherit the cities of their opponents. And in your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed, in return for your obeying my voice.’"

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "17:17b-28 and 18:1-5"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "Let brothers be useful in time of need, for this they are born. A foolish man claps and rejoices at himself, like one who stands surety for his own friends. One who loves sin rejoices at conflicts, while the hard-hearted does not meet with the good. A man of changing tongue will fall into evils, while a foolish heart is a pain for the one who possesses it. A father is not made glad by a son without instruction, but a prudent son makes his mother glad. A glad heart creates good health, but the bones of a sorrowful man dry up. The ways of one who takes gifts in his bosom unjustly do not prosper, while the ungodly perverts ways of righteousness. The face of a wise man is intelligent, but the eyes of the fool go to the extremities of the earth. A foolish son is anger for his father and a grief for her who gave him birth. To punish a just man is not good, nor is it holy to plot against just princes. One who forbears to utter a harsh word is discreet, while a long suffering man is discreet. Wisdom will be imputed to a fool who asks for wisdom, while one who holds his peace will seem to be prudent. A man who wishes to be parted from friends seeks excuses, but at every moment he will be subject to reproach. One who lacks sense has no need of wisdom, rather he is led by folly. Whenever the ungodly comes into a depth of evils he despises them, but dishonour and reproach come upon him. A word in a man’s heart is deep water, while a river and a source of life well up. It is not good to marvel at the face of the ungodly, nor holy to pervert what is just in giving judgement."
