lemcVE.reading1.text = "The Lord God, having considered, said: I will curse the earth again because of human works, because the human mind is bent intently on evils from youth. I will not again smite all living flesh as I have done. During all the days of the earth seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring will not cease by day and night. And God blessed Noë and his sons and said to them: Increase and multiply and fill the earth and have dominion over it, And the fear and dread of you will be on all the wild animals of the earth and on all the flying creatures of heaven, and of all the creatures that move on the earth and on all the fishes of the sea. I have put them under your hands. And every creeping thing which is living shall be for food for you; I have given all things to you as herbs of grass. Except that you are not eat meat with the blood of life. For the blood of your lives I shall require of all the wild beasts and I shall require the life of human from the hand of a fellow human. Whoever sheds human blood, he shall be shed instead of that blood, because I made humanity in the image of God. But you, increase and multiply and fill the earth and have dominion over it."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "11:19-31, 12:1-6"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "A righteous son is born for life, but the persecution of the ungodly is for death. Perverted ways are an abomination to the Lord, but all who are blameless in their ways are acceptable to him. One who with the hand strikes hands unjustly will not be unpunished, but one who sows justice will receive faithful recompense. Like a ear ring in a pig’s snout is beauty in a ill-minded woman. Every desire of the just is good, but the hope of the ungodly will perish. There are those who sow abroad their own possessions and make them more, but there are those who gather them in and are diminished. Every simple soul is blessed, but a passionate man is not noble. May the one that hoards corn leave it for the nations, but blessing be on the head of one who shares. One who devises good things seeks good grace, one who seeks out wicked ones, they will seize him. One who trusts in wealth is the one who will fall, but one who helps the righteous is the one who will rise. One who does not deal graciously with their own household will inherit wind, but the senseless will serve the wise. From the fruit of justice grows a tree of life, but the souls of transgressors are cut off unripe. If the just is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear? One who loves instruction loves sense, but one who hates rebukes is a fool. Better one who has found grace from the Lord, but a man who is a transgressor will be passed over in silence. A person will not succeed through transgression, but the roots of the righteous will not be pulled up. A courageous woman is a crown for her husband; but like a worm in wood, so a wife who does evil destroys her husband. The thoughts of the righteous are judgements, but the ungodly devise deceits. The words of the ungodly are deceitful, but the mouth of the upright will deliver them."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "25:1-9"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Lord my God, I will glorify you, I will praise your name, for you have done wondrous deeds, an ancient and true counsel. So be it. Because you have made cities a heap, cities strong so that foundations should not fall. Let the city of the ungodly not be built for ever. Therefore the poor people will bless you, and cities of those who have been wronged will bless you; for you have become a helper to every humble city and a protection to those downhearted through want, you will deliver them from evil people, be a protection to the thirsty and a breath for people who have been wronged; as down-hearted people, thirsting in Sion, because of ungodly people, to whom you handed us over. And the Lord Sabaoth will make (a banquet) for all the nations on this Mountain. They will drink joy, they will drink wine, they will anoint themselves with myrrh. On this mountain hand on all these things to the nations, for this Counsel is upon all the nations. Death has been strong and swallowed down, and again the Lord has taken away every tear from every face. The shame of the people he has taken away from all the earth; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this. And they will say in that day: See, the Lord our God, in whom we hoped and rejoiced, and he will save us. This is the Lord, we waited from him and we shall be glad, and we shall rejoice in his salvation."
