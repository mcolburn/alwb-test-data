Of all the clean beasts bring in to you seven by seven, male and female, while of the unclean beasts two by two, male and female, and of all the unclean flying creatures of heaven two by two, male and female, to maintain seed for all the earth. For yet seven days I am bringing rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights and I shall wipe out everything which I have made to rise up from the face of the whole earth. And Noë did everything that the Lord God had commanded him."

lemcVE.reading2.text = "My son, hear me, and blessed are they who guard my ways, hear instruction and be made wise and do not be stopped up. Blessed the man who will hearken to me, and a man who will guard my ways, keeping vigil at my doors day by day, keeping watch at the doorposts of my entrances; for my ways out are ways out to life, and favour is prepared from the Lord. Those who sin against me act impiously against their own souls; and those who hate me love death. Wisdom has built herself a house. She has slaughtered her beasts and mixed her wine in the mixing bowl, and prepared her table. She her sent out her servants, to invite with a loud proclamation upon the mixing bowl, ‘Whoever is foolish, let him turn to me’. And to those who lack wisdom she said, ‘Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for you. Abandon folly, that you may reign for ever; and seek prudence, and set aright your understanding with knowledge’. One who corrects the wicked will gain dishonour for himself. One who rebukes the impious will get blame for himself; for to the impious rebukes are blows. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate you. Rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man and he will be wiser; teach a just man and he will increase learning. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and the counsel of Saints, understanding. While to know the law is the part of a good mind. For by this means you will live for a long time, and years will be added to your life."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "10:12-20"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "It shall be when the Lord has accomplished doing all things on the mountain of Sion and in Jerusalem, he will bring upon the great mind the ruler of the Assyrians, and upon the height of the glory of his eyes. For he said: In strength I shall act and in the wisdom of the understanding, I shall remove the boundaries of nations and their strength I shall plunder and I shall shake inhabited cities and the whole inhabited world I shall abandon like a nest and I shall take away the eggs that have been abandoned, and there is none who will escape from me or contradict me. Will an axe be glorified without someone to cut with it? Or will a saw be exalted without someone to draw it, as if someone lifts up a rod or staff? And nor so, but the Lord Sabaoth will send dishonour against your honour, and burning fire will be kindled against your glory. And the light of Israel will be for fire, and he will sanctify him with burning fire and it devours the fuel like grass, On that day the mountains will be consumed, and the hills and the forests, and (the fire) devours from the soul right through to the flesh; and the one who flees will be like one who flees from a burning flame; and those of them who have been left behind shall be a number, and a child will write them. And it shall be in that day that the remnant of Israel will no longer be added to, and the saved of Jacob no longer trust in those who have wronged them, but they will trust in God the Holy One of Israel in truth."
