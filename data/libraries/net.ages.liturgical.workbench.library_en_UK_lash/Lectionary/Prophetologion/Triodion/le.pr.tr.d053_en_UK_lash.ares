lemcVE.reading1.text = "And the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision saying, ‘Fear not, Abram, I am shielding you. Your reward will be exceedingly great.’ But Abram said, ‘Master, Lord, what will you give me? I am departing childless, while the son of Masek my home-born female slave, this Eliezer of Damascus (will inherit)‘. And Abram said, ‘Since you have given me no seed my home-born slave will inherit from me.’ And the voice of the Lord came to him immediately, saying, ‘He will not inherit, but one who will come forth from you, he will inherit from you’. And he led him outside and said to him, ‘Look up to heaven and count the stars, if you can count them up’. And he said, ‘So shall your seed be’. And Abram believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness. And he said to him, ‘I am God who brought you out of the land of the Chaldeans so as to give you this land as your inheritance.’ But he said, ‘Master Lord, how will I know that I will inherit it?’ And he said to him, ‘Take me a three year old heifer and a three year old she-goat and a three year old ram and a dove and a pigeon.’ He took all these and split them down the middle and set them opposite one another, but the birds he did not split. But birds came down on the divided parts and Abram sat with them. About sunset a trance fell on Abram, and behold, a great darkness fell on him, and it was said to Abram, ‘You will surely know that your seed will be a sojourner in a land not their own, and they will enslave them and ill treat them and humiliate them for four hundred years. But the nation whom ever they will be slave to I will judge. But after these things they will come out here with much baggage. But you will go to your fathers in peace, nourished in a good old age.’"

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "15:7-19"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "The lips of the wise are bound by discretion, but the hearts of fools are not safe. The sacrifices of the ungodly are an abomination to the Lord, but the prayers of the upright are acceptable with him. An abomination to the Lord are the ways of the ungodly, but he loves those who pursue righteousness. The instruction of the innocent is known by those who pass by, but those who hate reproofs come to their end disgracefully. Hell and destruction are manifest to the Lord, how then shall not human hearts be also? An uninstructed person will not love those who rebuke him, but he will not converse with the wise. When the heart is glad the face is cheerful, but when it is in sorrows the face is sad. An upright heart seeks discretion, but the mouth of the uninstructed will know evils. The eyes of the evil look for evils all the time, but the good are always still. Better a small portion with fear of the Lord, than great treasures with no fear. Better entertainment of vegetables with friendship and grace than a spread of calves with enmity. An irate person prepares fights, but a long suffering one calms even a fight that is imminent. A long suffering person extinguishes quarrels, but an ungodly one rather stirs them up. The ways of the idle are strewn with thorns, but those of the hardworking are smoothed."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "41:4-14"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: I am first and for what is to come I am. The nations saw and were afraid, the ends of the earth drew near and came together, each one judging to help his neighbour and his brother, and he will say, ‘The craftsman has become strong and the bronze smith striking with the hammer and forging’. Then he will say, ‘It is a good join and they have fastened them with nails, they will fix them and they will not be moved’. You are my servant, I have chosen you and I have not abandoned you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not go astray, for I am your God who gives you strength and I have helped you and made you safe with my just right hand. See, all those who oppose you will be put to shame and turned back, for they will be as though they did not exist and all your opponents will perish. You will look for them and not find those who rage like drunkards against you, for those who make war on you will be as though they did not exist and they will not be. Because I am your God who gives might to your right hand and who says to you: Do not be afraid Jacob, Israel few in number. I have helped you, Israel, I the God who rescues you."
