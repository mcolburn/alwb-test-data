lemcVE.reading1.text = "These are the sons of Noë, who came out of the ark, Sem, Cham and Iapheth; Cham was the father of Canaan. These are the three sons of Noë; from these were men scattered over all the earth. And Noë began to be a farmer of the land, and he planted a vine; and he drank of the wine and became drunk and lay naked in his house. And Cham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and went out and told his two brothers outside. And Sem and Iapheth took a garment and put it on both their backs and walked backwards and covered up the nakedness of their father; and with their face backwards they did not see the nakedness of their father. But Noë awoke from the wine and realized what his younger son had done and he said, Canaan is accursed; he shall a servant boy to his brothers. And he said, ‘Blessed is Sem, and Canaan shall be his servant boy. May God broaden Iapheth, and may he dwell in the houses of Sem and let Canaan be his servant’. Noë lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. And all the days of Noë were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died. These are the generations of the sons of Noë: Sem, Cham and Iapheth, and sons were born to them after the flood."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "12:23-28 and 13:1-9"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "A man of understanding is a throne of perception, but the heart of fools will encounter curses. The hand of chosen ones will easily obtain might, but the deceitful will be for prey. A fearful word troubles the heart of the just, but a good message makes him glad. A just arbitrator will [be] his own friend, but the opinions of the ungodly are unfair. Evils will pursue those who sin, while the way of the ungodly will lead them astray. The deceitful will catch no wild game, but a pure man is a precious possession. In ways of righteousness is life, but [the] ways of those who remember wrongs lead to death. A clever son is obedient to his father, but a disobedient son is for destruction. The good eats from the fruits of justice, but the souls of transgressors perish unripe. One who guards his mouth will preserve his own soul, but one that has hasty lips will terrify himself. Every idle person lives in desires, but the hands of the brave are diligent. The just hates an unjust word, but the ungodly is put to shame and will not have boldness to speak. Justice guards the innocent, while sin makes the impious worthless. There are those who enrich themselves, though they have nothing, and there are those who humble themselves amid great wealth. His own wealth is a ransom of a man’s life, but the poor does not undergo threatening. There is always light for the just, but light is quenched for the ungodly. Deceitful souls go astray in sins, but the just show pity and mercy."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "28:14-22"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord: Hear the word of the Lord, you afflicted men and you rulers of this people which is in Jerusalem. Because you said, ‘We have made a covenant with Hell and agreements with Death. If a raging storm passes by, it will not come upon us. We have made falsehood our hope, and we will be sheltered by falsehood’, therefore thus says the Lord, the Lord. See, I am laying for the foundations of Sion a costly Stone, chosen, a corner-stone, precious for its foundations. And one who believes in it will not be put to shame. And I will set judgement for hope, but my compassion for balances. And those that trust vainly in falsehood, because the storm will not pass you by. And will it not remove your covenant of death? And hope you have in Hell will in no way remain. If a raging storm comes against you, you will be like a pavement for it. When it passes by, it will take you, because morning by morning it will pass by day, and in the night there will be an evil hope. Learn to hear, you the distressed; we cannot fight, while we are too weak for us to be gathered. The will raise you up like a mountain of the ungodly, and he will be in the valley of Gabaon. With fury he will do his works, a work of bitterness. While his wrath will do what is unheard of, and its bitterness will be unheard of. And do rejoice nor let your bonds be strong, because I have heard from the Lord Sabaoth things accomplished and cut short, which he will do over the whole earth."
