lemcTE.reading1.text = "In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw a vision of God. On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Joachim), the word of the Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was on me. As I looked, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud with brightness around it and fire flashing forth continually, and in the middle of the fire, an appearance of amber, and a radiance in it. In the middle of it was a likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they were of human form. Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. Their legs were straight, and their feet were winged; and there were sparks like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead, without turning as they moved. As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an calf on the left side, and the face of an eagle; such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies. Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went. In the middle of the living creatures there was an appearance that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire. The living creatures darted to and fro, like a form of Bezek. As I looked, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel. When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved. Their rims were tall. And I saw that the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. Wherever the cloud was, there also the spirit would go; the living creatures went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of life was in the wheels."
