lemcVE.reading1.text = "And the brothers brought Joseph the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house; and they prostrated before him with their faces to the ground. But he asked them, ’How are you?’ and he said to them, ’Is your father, the old man of whom you spoke, well? Is he still alive?’ And they said, ’Your servant our father is well. He is still alive.’ And he said, ’That man is blessed by God’. And bowing down, they prostrated before him. And Joseph, lifting up his eyes, saw his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother, and said, ’Is this your younger brother, whom you said you would bring to me?’ and he said, ’God have mercy on you, my child.’ And Joseph was deeply troubled, for so strong was the affection he felt for his brother that he wanted to weep; and he went into his private chamber, and wept there. And having washed his face and came out and controlled himself. And Joseph could not refrain him with everyone standing near him, but he said, ’Send everyone away from me.’ And no one stood near Joseph, when he made himself known to his brethren. And he cried aloud with weeping. All the Egyptians heard, and it became known Pharao’s house. But Joseph said to his brothers, ’I am Joseph. Is my father still alive? And his brothers could not answer him, for they were deeply troubled. But Joseph said to his brothers, ’Come near me’; and they came near. And he said, ’I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. Now then do not be grieved, and do not let it seem hard to you that you sold me here, for God sent me before you for life. For this is the second year there is famine in the land, and there are still five years left, in which there will be neither ploughing, nor harvest. For God sent me before you that a remnant might be left for you on earth to nourish a great remnant of you. Now then it was not you that sent me here, but God; and he has made me like a father to Pharao, and lord of all his house, and ruler of all the land of Egypt. Hurry, therefore, and go up to my father, and say to him, ’This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all the land of Egypt; come down therefore to me, and do not delay. And you shall dwell in the land of Gesem of Arabia; and you shall be near me, you and your sons, and your sons’ sons, your sheep and your oxen, and whatever is yours; and I will nourish you there—for there are still five years of famine—lest you and your sons, and all your possessions be wiped out. Look, your own eyes can see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin can see, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. Report, therefore, to my father all my glory in Egypt, and everything you have seen, and make haste and bring down my father here.’ And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept on him; and Benjamin wept on his neck. And he kissed all his brothers, and wept on them; and after this his brothers spoke to him. And the report was carried into Pharao’s house, saying, ’Joseph’s brothers have come.’ And Pharao rejoiced, and his household."

lemcVE.reading2.chapverse = "21:23-31 and 22:1-4"
lemcVE.reading2.text = "One that guards their mouth and tongue keeps their soul from affliction. An arrogant, self-willed and boastful person is called a plague; while one that remembers ills is a transgressor. Desires kill the sluggard; for his hands do not choose to do anything. An ungodly person longs for evil desires all day; but the just is ungrudgingly merciful and compassionate. The sacrifices of the ungodly are abomination to the Lord, for they offer them lawlessly. A false witness will perish; but an obedient man will speak cautiously. An ungodly man brazenly gives undertakings in person; but the upright himself understands his ways. There is no wisdom, there is no courage, there is no counsel against the ungodly. A horse is prepared for the day of war; but help is from the Lord. A good name is better than great wealth, while good favour is above silver and gold. A rich and a poor person met together; but the Lord made them both. An intelligent man seeing a bad man severely chastised is himself disciplined, but fools pass by and are punished. The offspring of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and wealth, and glory, and life."

lemcTE.reading1.chapverse = "65:8-16"
lemcTE.reading1.text = "Thus says the Lord, As when a grape in found in the cluster, people will say, Do not destroy it; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for the sake of the one that serves me, for that person’s sake I will not destroy them all. And I will lead out the posterity of Jacob and that of Juda, and they shall inherit my holy mountain: and my chosen ones shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there. And there shall be in the forest folds of flocks, and the valley of Achor will be a resting for herds for my people, who have sought me. But you that have deserted me, and forget my holy mountain, and prepare a table for the devil, and fill up a drink-offering to Fortune, I will hand you over to the sword, you shall all fall by slaughter: for I called you, and you did not obey; I spoke, and you disobeyed; and you did evil in my sight, and chose the things I did not want. Therefore thus says the Lord, See, those who serve me shall eat, while you shall go hungry. See, those who serve me shall drink, while you shall go thirsty. See, those who serve me shall rejoice, while you shall be ashamed. See, those who serve me shall exult with joy, while you shall cry because of the pain of your heart, and howl from the affliction of your spirit. For you shall leave behind your name for the satisfaction of my chosen ones, but the Lord shall destroy you, while those who serve me shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed on the earth; for they shall bless the true God."
