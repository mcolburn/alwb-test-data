lemcVE.reading1.text = "When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last, and was gathered to his people. And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept over him, and kissed him. And Joseph commanded his servants the embalmers to embalm his father; and the embalmers embalmed Israel. And they completed forty days for him, for this is the number of days for burial; and Egypt mourned him for seventy days. And when the days of mourning were over, Joseph spoke to Pharao’s princes, saying, If I have found favour in your sight, speak concerning me in Pharao’s ears, saying, My father made me swear an oath, saying, In the sepulchre which I dug for myself in the land of Chanaan, there you are to bury me. Now therefore I will go up and bury my father, and come back again. And Pharao said to Joseph, Go up, bury your father, as he made you swear. So Joseph went up to bury his father; and all Pharao's servants went up with him, and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and Joseph's whole household, and his brothers, and all his father’s house. But they left behind his family and the sheep and the oxen in the land of Gesem. And there went up with him also chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company. And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan; and they lamented him with great and intense lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father for seven days. And the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw the mourning at the floor of Atad, and said, ’This is a great mourning for the Egyptians’; therefore they called the name of the place, which is beyond Jordan, The Mourning of Egypt. And this is what his sons did for him. And his sons carried him up into the land of Chanaan, and buried him in the double cave, the cave Abraham had bought for possession of a burial place, from Ephrom the Chettite, facing Mambre. And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and those who had gone up with him to bury his father. But when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, 'Perhaps Joseph will bear malice against us, and pay us back all the evils which we did against him. And they came to Joseph, and said, Your father made us swear an oath before his death, saying, ’Speak to Joseph as follows, Forgive them their injustice and their sin, for they have done evil against you; and now forgive the injustice of the servants of the God of your father’. And Joseph wept as they spoke to him. And they came to him and said, We here are your servants. And Joseph said to them, ’Do not be afraid, for I am God’s. You took counsel against me for evil, but God took counsel for me for good, so that things might be as they are today, and many people might be fed’. And he said to them, ’Do not be afraid, I will support you, and your families’. And he encouraged them, and spoke kindly to them. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his brothers, and all his father's family. And Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation; and the sons of Machir, Manasse’s son were born on Joseph’s thighs. And Joseph spoke to his bothers, saying, ’I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and will bring you out of this land into the land which God swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob’. And Joseph made the sons of Israel, swear an oath, saying, ’At the visitation with which God will visit you, then you shall carry up my bones from here with you’. And Joseph died, aged a hundred and ten; and they prepared his corpse, and put him in a coffin in Egypt."

lemcVE.reading2.text = "Open your mouth with the word of God, and judge all things fairly. Open your mouth and judge justly, and defend the poor and weak. Who can find a dynamic wife? Such a wife is more valuable than precious stones. The heart of her husband has confidence in her: such a wife will not be in need of fine spoils. For she achieves good for her husband all her life long. Winding off wool and flax, she makes it serviceable with her hands. She is like a ship trading from afar: and she gathers her wealth. And she rises by night, and gives food to her household, and tasks to her maidservants. She views a farm, and buys it: and with the fruit of her hands she plants a plot of land. She strongly girds her loins, and sets her arms to work. She knows by experience that working is good; and her lamp is not extinguished all night. She reaches out her arms to what is needful, and applies her hands to the spindle. She opens her hands to the poor, and hands out fruit to the needy. Her husband is not anxious about those at home when he delays somewhere: for all those round her are clothed. She makes outer garments of double thickness for her husband, and garments of fine linen and scarlet for herself. Her husband becomes a an object of admiration in the gates, when he sits in council with the senior inhabitants of the land. She makes fine linens and sells them to the Phoenicians, and girdles to the Canaanites. She puts on strength and glory; and rejoices in the last days. She opens her mouth with care and with propriety, and keeps control over her tongue. The ways of her household are careful, and she does not eat the bread of idleness. She opens her mouth wisely, and in accordance with law. And her generosity establishes her children, and they grow rich, and her husband praises her. Many daughters have obtained power, many have gained wealth; but you have exceeded, and surpassed them all. Charms are false, and a woman's beauty is worthless: for it is a woman of understanding that is blessed, and let her praise the fear the Lord. Give her of the fruit of her lips; and let her husband be praised in the gates."
