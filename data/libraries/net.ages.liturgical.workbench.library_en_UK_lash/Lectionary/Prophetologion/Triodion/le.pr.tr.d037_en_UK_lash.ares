lemcTE.reading1.text = "Sanctify the Lord God, and he shall be your fear; and if you trust in him, he will be for your sanctification, and you will not meet with him as a stumbling stone, nor as a falling on a rock; while the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and those who dwell in Jerusalem in a hollow. Because of this many among them will become powerless and will fall and be smashed, and they will draw near and men will be taken in safety. Then they will be manifest who seal themselves not to learn my law. And he will say: I shall wait for God who has turned away his face from the house of Jacob and I shall trust in him. Behold I and the children whom God has given me, and they shall be signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord Sabaoth, who dwells on the mountain of Sion. And if they say to you: Seek out ventriloquists and those who speak from the earth, and those who speak emptiness, those who speak out of their bellies, shall a nation not seek out its God? Why do they seek they dead concerning the living? For he gave the law for a help, that they should speak not according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give concerning it. And harsh famine will come upon you; and it shall be that when you are hungry you shall be grieved and speak ill of the ruler and your ancestral customs, and they will look up to the heaven above, and they will look on the earth below, and behold dire distress and darkness, tribulation and misery and darkness, so that it is impossible to see; and he who in distress will not be distressed only for a moment. [9:1] Do this first, do this quickly, country of Zavoulon, land of Nephthalim, way of the sea and the rest of the inhabitants of the sea coast and beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations, the parts of Judea. The people who walked in darkness, see, a great light! You who dwell in the country and shadow of death a light will shine on you [There is an interesting difference, due to iotacism, between the text here and that in Great Compline, which reads ‘us’ rather than ‘you’. The Book of Hours also has a singular imperative in the previous sentence.]. The most part of the people which you brought down in your joy, they too will be rejoice before you as those who rejoice at harvest and in the way of those who divide the spoil. Because the yoke which lay on them and the rod that was on their neck has been taken away; for the Lord has scattered the rod of those who demanded, as in the day of Madiam. For they shall pay restitution for every robe that has been collected by trickery and every garment with exchange; and they will be willing even if they had been burnt by fire. Because a child has been for us, a son too has been given to us, whose rule was upon his shoulder, and his name is called Angel of great counsel, wondrous counsellor, mighty God, potentate, prince of peace, father of the age to come; for I shall bring peace upon the princes, peace and health to him. Great is his rule and of his peace there is no limit upon the throne of David and his kingdom to establish it and assist it with judgement and with justice from now and for ever; the zeal of the Lord Sabaoth will do all this."
