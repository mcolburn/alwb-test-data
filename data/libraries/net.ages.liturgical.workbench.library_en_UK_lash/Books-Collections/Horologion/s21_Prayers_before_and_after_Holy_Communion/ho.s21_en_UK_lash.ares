hoPCPrayer.EnTaisLambrotisi.text = "How shall I, the unworthy, enter among the splendours of your Saints? For if I dare to enter with them into the bridal chamber, my dress convicts me, for it is not a wedding garment, and I shall be bound and cast out by the Angels. Cleanse the stain of my soul, Lord, and save me, as you love humankind."

hoPCPrayer.DespotaFilanthrope.text = "Master, lover of humankind, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, do not let these holy Mysteries be for my condemnation because I am unworthy, but rather for the cleansing and sanctification of both soul and body and as a pledge of the life and kingdom to come. It is good for me to cleave to God, to place in the Lord the hope of my salvation."
