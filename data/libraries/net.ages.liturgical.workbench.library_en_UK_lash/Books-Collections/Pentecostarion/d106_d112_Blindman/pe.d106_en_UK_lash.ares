I must do the works of him who sent me, which none can do.\" So saying you spat on the ground, made clay, and anointed his eyes, and said, \"Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam.\" When he had washed he became whole and cried out to you, \"I believe Lord.\" And he worshipped you. Therefore we too cry out: Have mercy on us!"
