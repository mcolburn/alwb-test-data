Fortify them with your divine unity; for you from the beginning created male and female, and by your will is woman joined to man for help and for the continuance of the human race. Yes, Lord our God, who sent your truth upon your inheritance and your promise upon your servants our Fathers, your chosen ones from generation to generation, look down upon your servants (N) and (N), and strengthen their betrothal in faith and concord and truth and love; for it was you, Lord, who taught us to give our pledge through a ring and to remain faithful in everything. Through a ring the authority was given to Joseph in Egypt; through a ring Daniel was glorified in the land of Babylon; through a ring the true identity of Thamar was discovered; through a ring our heavenly Father showed mercy on the prodigal son; for he said: \"Put a ring on his finger, and bring the fatted calf and kill it, so that we can eat and rejoice\". Your right hand, O Lord, enabled Moses to cross the Red Sea; by your true word the heavens were made firm and the earth was established; and the right hand of your servants shall be blessed by your mighty word and your upraised arm. Do you now, O Master, bless this putting on of rings with a heavenly blessing; and may an Angel of the Lord go before them all the days of their lives."

euWED.Key0210.text = "O God most pure, the Maker of all creation, in your love for man you transformed the rib of our forefather Adam into woman, and blessed them and said: \"Be fruitful and multiply, and have dominion over the earth\"; and you made the two of them one member through union. For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his own wife, and the two shall be one flesh; and those whom God has yoked together, let no man separate. You blessed your servant Abraham by granting Sarah offspring, and made him the father of many nations; you gave Isaac to Rebecca and blessed their child; you joined Jacob to Rachel, and from him brought forth the twelve Patriarchs; you united Joseph and Asenath, and granted them Ephraim and Manasseh as offspring; you responded to Zacharias and Elizabeth, and made their son the Forerunner; from the root of Jesse you brought forth in the flesh the ever-Virgin Mary, from which you became incarnate and were born for the salvation of the human race; in your inexpressible grace and great goodness you traveled to Cana of Galilee and blessed the wedding there, in order to show that lawful union and the procreation of children from it are indeed your will: Do you, all-holy Master, accept the prayer of us your supplicants, and, as you were there with them, be here also with us through your invisible presence. Bless this marriage and grant to your servants (N) and (N) a tranquil life, long years, mature judgement, love for each other in the bond of peace, long-lasting posterity, grace on their children, a crown of everlasting glory. Make them worthy to see their children's children; preserve their marital bed inviolate; and bestow upon them the dew of heaven from above and all the riches of the earth; fill their home with wheat, wine and oil, and with every good thing, so that they may give to those in need; and grant to those here present all their requests that lead to salvation."
euWED.Key0211.text = "For you are the God of mercy and compassion and love, and to you we ascribe glory, together with your beginningless Father, and your all-holy and good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to the ages of ages."
euWED.Key0212.text = "Blessed are you, O Lord our God, celebrant of the mystical and pure marriage, law-giver of the marriage of the body, guardian of incorruption and righteous steward of the gifts of this life. In the beginning, O master, you created man and established him as the king of creation, and said: \"It is not good that man should be alone on the earth; let us make a helper fit for him;\" and taking one of his ribs you formed woman, and when Adam saw her he said: \"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of her man\". For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his own wife, and the two shall be one flesh; and those whom God has yoked together, let no man separate. Do you, now, Lord and Master, our God, send down your heavenly grace upon your servants (N) and (N); and grant that this maiden may in all things submit to the man, and that this your servant may be the head of the woman, so that they may live according to your will. Bless them, O Lord our God, as you blessed Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and all the Patriarchs, Joseph and Asenath, Moses and Zipporah, Joachim and Anna, Zacharias and Elizabeth. Guard them, O Lord our God, as you guarded Noah in the Ark, Jonah in the the belly of the whale, and the three holy youths from the fire, by sending down upon them dew from heaven; and let there come upon them that great joy which the blessed Helena felt when she found the precious Cross. Remember them, O Lord our God, as you remembered Enoch, Shem and Elias; as you remembered your holy Forty Martyrs, on whom you sent down crowns from heaven. Remember, O Lord our God, the parents who brought them up, for the blessings of parents make firm the foundations of homes. Remember, O Lord our God, your servants the attendants, who have come together to share in this rejoicing. Remember, O Lord our God, your servant (N) and your servant (N), and bless them. Grant them the fruit of the womb, fair children, oneness of souls and bodies. Exalt them as the cedars of Lebanon, as a luxuriant vine. Graciously give to them the fullness of blessings so that, being sufficient in everything, they may abound in every good work that is acceptable to you, and may see their children's children like newly-planted olive trees round about their table; and, having pleased you in every way, may shine as the stars of heaven, in you our Lord; to whom are due all glory, dominion, honor and worship, now and ever, and to the ages of ages."
euWED.Key0213.text = "Holy God, who created man out of dust and from his rib fashioned woman, whom you joined to him as a helper fit for him, for it seemed good to your majesty that man should not be alone on the earth; do you now, O Master, stretch out your hand from your holy dwelling place, and join your servant (N) and your servant (N) (and joins their hands) for by you is woman joined to man. Yoke them in oneness of mind; crown them into one flesh; grant them the fruit of the womb, the joy or fair children."
