levaWED.Epistle.text = "Brethren, always give thanks for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God the Father, and be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, be subject to your husbands as to the Lord; for the man is the head of the woman, just as Christ also is the head of the Church, and he is, indeed, the savior of the body. But just as the Church is subject to Christ, so must women be to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word that he might present her to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and without blemish. In the same way men are bound to love their wives as they love their own bodies. In loving his wife a man loves himself. For no one ever hated his own body but provides and cares for it as the Lord does the Church; for we are living parts of his body, of his flesh and of his bones; for this reason shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak in reference to Christ and Church. Yet each one of you individually must love his wife as his very self, and the wife must see to it that she treat her husband with respect."
