levaWED.Gospel.text = "At that time there was a wedding at Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine gave out, Jesus's Mother said to him: \"They have no wine.\" Jesus said to her: \"Why should that concern you and me, lady? My hour has not yet come\". His mother said to the servants: \"Whatever he tells you to do, do it.\" There were six stone water jars standing near, of the kind used for Jewish rites of purification, holding twenty of thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them: \"Fill the jars with water,\" and they filled them up to the brim. Then he said to them: \"Now draw some out and take it to the steward of the feast\"; and they did so. When the steward of the feast tasted the water, now turned into wine, (not knowing its source, even though the servants knew), he called the groom and said to him: \"Everyone serves the good wine first, and when everybody has had plenty to drink, then that which is not so good; but you have kept the good wine till now!\" This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him."
